<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p>Despite the fact that much has been written during the past two or
  three years with reference to Eugenics, it is quite evident to any one
  interested in the subject that the average intelligent individual knows
  very little about it so far as its scope and intent are concerned. This
  is not to be wondered at, for the subject has not been presented to the
  ordinary reader in a form that would tend to encourage inquiry or honest
  investigation. The critic and the wit have deliberately misinterpreted
  its principles, and have almost succeeded in masking its supreme function
  in the garb of folly.</p>

  <p>The writer has yet to meet a conscientious mother who fails to evince
  a reasonable degree of enthusiastic interest in eugenics when properly
  informed of its fundamental principles.</p>

  <p>The eugenic ideal is a worthy race&mdash;a race of men and women
  physically and mentally capable of self-support. The eugenist, therefore,
  demands that every child born shall be a worthy child&mdash;a child born
  of healthy, selected parents.</p>

  <p>No one can successfully assail the ethics of this appeal. It is
  morally a just contention to strive for a healthy race. It is also an
  economic necessity as we shall see.</p>

  <p>The history of the world informs us that there have been many
  civilizations which, in some respects, equalled our own. These races of
  people have all achieved a certain success, and have then passed entirely
  out of existence. Why? <i>And are we destined to extinction in the same
  way?</i> We know that the cause of the decline and ultimate extinction of
  all past civilizations was due primarily to the moral decadence of their
  people. Disease and vice gradually sapped their vitality, and their <!--
  Page xx --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx"></a>[xx]</span>
  continuance was impossible. It would seem to be the destiny of a race to
  achieve material prosperity at the expense of its morality. When
  conditions render possible the fulfilment of every human desire, the race
  exhausts its vitality in a surfeitment of caprice. The animal instincts
  predominate, and the potential vigor of the people is exhausted in
  contributing to its own amusement. Each succeeding civilization has
  reached this epochal period, and has fallen, victim of the rapacity of
  stronger and younger invading antagonists, <i>themselves to succumb to
  the same insidious process</i>.</p>

  <p>The present civilization has reached this epochal&mdash;this
  transition&mdash;period. In one hundred years from now we shall either
  have accomplished what no previous civilization accomplished, or we shall
  have ceased to exist as a race. Our success depends on the response of
  the people to the eugenic appeal. Few appreciate the responsibility
  involved.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary, however, to combat or deplore the evils of the
  past. Civilization has failed in the task of race-maintenance; it failed,
  however, in ignorance. We cannot plead the same excuse. We are face to
  face with conditions that we must solve quickly or our destiny will be
  decreed before we apply the remedy.</p>

  <p>A function of the eugenist is to gather and attest statistics, and to
  establish conclusions based on these statistics. It has been conclusively
  demonstrated that, if the race continues to progress as it exists
  now&mdash;that is, if conditions remain the same, and our standard of
  enlightenment, so far as racial evolution is concerned, does not prompt
  us to adopt new constructive measures&mdash;<i>every second child born in
  this country, in fifty years, will be unfit; and, in one hundred years,
  the American race will have ceased to exist</i>. We mean by this that
  every second child born will be born to die in infancy, or, if it lives,
  will be incapable of self-support during its life, because either of
  mental degeneracy or physical inefficiency. This appalling situation
  immediately becomes a problem of civilization. No state can exist under
  these conditions. If these statistics are reliable&mdash;and we know they
  are true and capable of verification by any individual who will go <!--
  Page xxi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi"></a>[xxi]</span> to
  the trouble of investigating them&mdash;it is self-evident that a radical
  change must immediately be instituted to obviate the logical consequences
  that must follow as a sequence. The eugenic demand, that "every child
  born shall be a worthy child," is, therefore, the solution of the
  problem.</p>

  <p>This does not imply, however, that the eugenist must solve the
  elementary problem of how the state will ensure its own salvation by
  guaranteeing worthy children. Worthy children can come only from fit and
  worthy (clean and healthy) parents. It becomes the imperative function of
  the state&mdash;the function on which the very life of the state
  depends&mdash;to see that every applicant for marriage is possessed of
  the qualities that will ensure healthy, worthy children. We must,
  therefore, sooner or later devise a system of scientific regulation of
  marriage, and it is at this point we stumble against the problem that has
  prompted the ebullitions of the wit and the sarcasm of the critic. A
  casual reference to the science immediately suggests to the layman an
  impossible or quixotic system of marriage by force. Even the word
  "eugenics" is associated in the minds of many otherwise estimable old
  ladies, and others who should know better, with a species of malodorous
  free love, and their hands go up in holy horror at the intimation of a
  scientific regulation of this ancient function.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the popular mind has received the impression that this
  incident constitutes the sum total of the eugenic idea, while the truth
  is that the eugenist is only slightly concerned with its modus operandi.
  This feature has been so magnified by widely published disingenuous
  discussion that it has assumed the aspect of a test problem, a judgment
  on which shall decide the utility of the science itself. Should this
  decision be unfavorable, it would seem, according to its exponents, that
  it would not be worth while promulgating the doctrines of the science
  beyond this point. It is as though we were asked to deny ourselves the
  inspiration and pleasure of a trip abroad because the morning of the day
  on which the ship sailed happened to be cloudy.</p>

  <p>It is certainly no part of the function of the eugenist to <!-- Page
  xxii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxii"></a>[xxii]</span> uproot
  instinct, or to trample into the dust age-long rights, though the
  instinct is simply the product of an established habit, based on an
  erroneous hypothesis, and the so-called rights simply acquired
  privileges, because the intelligence that would have builded differently
  was not awakened. Eugenic necessity will render imperative the state's
  solution of this fundamental problem, for the reason that civilization
  will be driven to demand its just inheritance&mdash;the right to exist.
  The eugenist will not be compelled to open the door; it will be opened
  for him. We can afford, therefore, to wait with supreme confidence,
  because the good sense of the people will not always submit to the
  tactics of the jester when it needs a saviour.</p>

  <p>The eugenist does not seek to interfere with the liberties of the
  rising generation: a boy may choose whom he will; the girl may select the
  one who appeals to her most, and they may enjoy all the vested rights and
  romance that custom has decreed the lover; but, when they resolve to
  marry, <i>the state must decide their qualifications for parenthood</i>.
  This must be the crucial test of the future. The life of the state
  depends on it. The continuance of the race must be the supreme object of
  all future constructive legislation. We must recognize that "life is the
  only wealth," and that every other criterion of an advanced civilization
  must measure its success according to its wealth in worthy
  parenthood.</p>

  <p>The eugenist does not even dictate what the test for parenthood shall
  be. Common sense, however, suggests that it will assume some form that
  will eliminate those physically or mentally diseased. He believes that,
  when the people are sufficiently educated to appreciate the object in
  view, they will devise a system that will meet with universal
  approval.</p>

  <p>Eugenics concerns itself with problems on which the destiny of the
  race depends. It must not, therefore, be limited to questions relative to
  mating and breeding. Every factor that contributes to the well-being and
  uplifting of the race, every subject that bespeaks physical or mental
  regeneration, that aids moral and social righteousness and salvation, and
  promises a greater social happiness and contentment, has a eugenic <!--
  Page xxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span> significance. So long as there exists
  an unsupported mother or a suffering child; so long as we rely on
  hospitals and prisons, penitentiaries and the police, to minister to the
  correction and regeneration of the unfit and degenerate; so long as we
  tolerate grafting politicians and deprive the poor of breathing spaces,
  sanitary appliances, and a hygienic environment; so long as war and
  pestilence deprive posterity of the best of the race for parenthood; so
  long as we emphasize rescue rather than prevention, so long must the
  eugenist strive unceasingly to preach his propaganda of race
  regeneration.</p>

  <p>The scope of eugenics is too far-reaching in its beneficent purpose to
  be fettered by the querulous triflings of the ancient or intellectual
  prude; nor should it be belittled by the superficial insight of the
  habitual scoffer. It is not a fantasy nor an idle dream. It is not even
  an inspiration. The destiny of the race has brought us face to face with
  conditions unparalleled in the history of this civilization, and the very
  existence of the race itself may be wholly dependent on the foresight of
  the minds that have made the science of eugenics possible.</p>

  <p>A brief consideration of the conditions that actually exist, with
  which we are face to face, and which certainly justify the existence of a
  science whose function it should be to demand serious investigation of
  methods of race regeneration, may help the reader to an intelligent and
  practical understanding of the tremendous importance of the subject.</p>

  <p>It has been already remarked that, at the present rate of decrease,
  the birth-rate will be reduced to zero within a century. If the
  birth-rates in England, Germany, and France should continue to decrease
  as they have since 1880, there would be no children born, one hundred
  years hence, in these countries. While we do not assert, and probably
  none of us believes that either or all of these nations will actually be
  out of existence in a hundred years&mdash;unquestionably because we feel,
  at least we hope, that our methods will be so changed in that time that
  the necessary modification will ensure a continuance of the race,
  nevertheless, the fact remains that <i>the inevitable <!-- Page xxiv
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span> result of
  continuing along present lines will be that, within the period of one
  hundred years, these peoples will cease to perpetuate themselves</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to enquire closely into the various causes for
  this unparalleled situation. The falling birth-rate in itself is not the
  prime cause. Even admitting that there are enough babies born, too many
  of them are born only to die in infancy. We need no further proof of the
  urgent need for conscientious inquiry, call it by what name you please.
  The science of common sense is all-sufficient. The seemingly intelligent
  individual who can only find material for ribaldry in this connection is
  a more serious buffoon than he imagines. It is apparent that our methods
  are wrong. Any constructive effort to correct them is commendable. When
  it is stated that 20 per cent. of the American women are unable to bear
  children, and that 25 per cent. of all the others are unwilling to assume
  the burden and responsibility of motherhood, we partly realize the
  gravity of the case.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, statistics show that the majority of men have
  acquired disease before they marry, and that a very large percentage of
  these men convey contagion to their wives. This condition, to a very
  large extent, accounts for the inefficiency of women as mothers. It is
  responsible for at least 75 per cent. of the sterility that exists. The
  effect of this deplorable condition is directly responsible, also, for
  the ill health that afflicts women and that renders necessary the daily
  operations of a serious nature that are conducted in every hospital in
  every city in the civilized world. As a result of the dissemination of
  this poison, children are born blind, or are born to die, or, if they
  live, they are compelled to carry all through their helpless lives the
  stigma of disease and degeneration. It would surely seem that the
  individual to whom God has given intelligence and a conscience cannot
  think of these, the saddest facts in human experience, without resentment
  and humility. <i>Surely the time has arrived when every boy should know,
  from his earliest youth, that there is here on earth an actual punishment
  for vicious living as frightful as any that the mind of man can
  conceive.</i> <!-- Page xxv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxv"></a>[xxv]</span></p>

  <p>When we inquire into the cause of this trend toward race degeneracy,
  we find that poverty and the inability of the workingman to support large
  families, luxurious living, and the life of ease and amusement on the
  part of the women of wealth; the fact that an increasingly large number
  of women have entered professions that prevent motherhood, and that the
  number of apartment-houses where children are not wanted are on the
  increase, all play their part. In this age of intense living, it is not
  to be wondered at that many shrink from the responsibility of rearing
  children, and the same conditions that contribute to this decadent ideal
  intensifies sex-hunger, and it is this dominating passion that tolerates
  and makes possible the most frightful crime of the age&mdash;infanticide.
  Greece and Rome paved the way for their ultimate annihilation when their
  beautiful women ceased to bear children and their men sought the
  companionship of courtesans.</p>

  <p>Baby contests have demonstrated that only one child in ten was found
  to be good enough to justify a second examination. In a test examination
  in the public schools, only eight in five thousand were competent to
  qualify in all the tests. One of these eight was a Chinese boy and
  another an American-born son of a native Greek. Of the twenty million
  school-children in the United States, not less than 75 per cent. need
  immediate attention for physical defects.</p>

  <p>While man has been assiduously improving everything else, he has
  neglected to better his own condition. Every animal that man has taken
  from its native haunts and domesticated, he has efficiently improved. He
  has even produced more marvelous results by the application of the same
  principles to the vegetable kingdom. In his haste to civilize himself,
  however, he has failed to apply the principles that are essential to
  self-preservation. It is regrettable, also, to know that, while the
  government has spent many thousands of dollars in sending out literature
  to the farmers, instructing them how to raise profitable crops and to
  breed prize horses and pigs, absolutely none of the public money has been
  used in instructing American mothers how to raise healthy children. <!--
  Page xxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span></p>

  <p>A distinguished insurance expert has proved that there was an increase
  of nearly 100 per cent. in the mortality from degenerative diseases in
  the United States between 1880 and 1909. The growing prevalence of these
  diseases indicates a falling-off in the vitality of the race. It means
  that the diseases of old age are invading the younger ranks.</p>

  <p>The Life Extension Institute, of New York City, in its recent report,
  states that "forty of every hundred men and women employed in the Wall
  Street district require medical attention; twenty of the forty need it
  immediately, and ten of the forty must have it to avert serious
  results."</p>

  <p>There are from one-quarter to three-quarters of a million of
  preventable deaths every years in this country. That number of
  individuals could have been saved with proper care and attention to
  health in the early stages of disease, or before it gained a start.
  Practically all the diseases that carry business men off prematurely are
  curable in the early stages.</p>

  <p>Of the percentage of Wall Street men who need medical attention
  immediately, most have kidney or heart disease. The others are victims of
  typical unhygienic habits, such as fast, gluttonous eating, neglect of
  exercise, too much tobacco and liquor, and bad posturing in the office.
  The business man considers these trifles, but they count heavily.</p>

  <p>Business efficiency is greatly increased, first, by selecting men
  physically fit for work, and, second, by keeping them in that condition.
  There is a tremendous waste from inefficiency constantly going on, due to
  impaired health. Wall Street has an astonishing corps of
  neurasthenics.</p>

  <p>We need a broader interpretation of the term Eugenics, so that we may
  gain a more sympathetic and tolerant audience. The remedy does not lie in
  an academic discussion of these problems; to continue the debate behind
  closed doors will not lead anywhere: the public must be educated to a
  just appreciation of existing conditions and the remedy must be the
  product of effort on its part.</p>

  <p>Any condition that fundamentally means race <!-- Page xxvii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span> deterioration must
  be rendered intolerable. The prevalant dancing craze is an anti-eugenic
  institution, as is the popularity of the delicatessen store. No sane
  person can regard with complacency the vicious environment in which the
  future mothers of the race "tango" their time, their morals, and their
  vitality away. We do not assume to pass judgment on the merits of the
  dance; we do, however, emphatically condemn the surroundings.</p>

  <p>The moving-picture shows, vaudeville entertainments, dancing
  carnivals, the ease of travel, the laxity of laws, the opportunities for
  promiscuous interviews, all tend to give youth a false impression of the
  reality of life and to make the path of the degenerate easy and
  attractive.</p>

  <p>The history of civilization is, curiously enough, the story of
  masculine brutality, self-indulgence, and vice. The history of the world
  also proves that woman's sphere has been to submit patiently and silently
  to injustice and imposition. <i>Practical eugenics is the first worthy
  effort in the history of all time to hold men and women responsible for
  their mode of living.</i> It is a mighty problem. There is no greater nor
  more difficult one to be solved. It has taken eons to bring men to the
  point of questioning their right to do as they please; it will take time
  to compel them to realize their disgrace and acknowledge their duty. When
  we consider that there are eighty thousand women condemned to
  professional moral degradation in the City of London, and that every
  so-called civilized city on the globe contributes its pro rata share to
  this army of potential mothers, we begin to appreciate the vastness of
  the task.</p>

  <p>Eugenics has already accomplished what no other movement has ever
  accomplished: it has created the spirit that gave birth to the thought of
  men's responsibility, and it has taught us that the female of the race
  has rights. We can now speak without fear; the light is no longer
  hidden.</p>

  <p>Women must realize, however, that they have contributed, and continue
  to contribute, to race degeneracy. We hear and read much about the double
  standard of morals. As long as woman are willing to marry their daughters
  to reformed rakes, providing they have money <!-- Page xxviii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span> and social
  position, so long shall we have a double standard. So long as young
  society women go into hysterics over pedigreed dogs and horses and then
  marry men reeking in filthy unfitness for parenthood, mothers cannot
  expect any other standard of morals. So long as one marriage in twelve
  ends in divorce, the ethics of the female need enlightenment. We shall
  not get another standard of morals until women themselves demand it and
  insist on it. If they lend themselves to breaking down the conspiracy of
  silence, the women may solve the marriage problem by refusing to marry
  rakes.</p>

  <p>We need a more liberal construction of the intent of eugenics in order
  to clarify the obtuse minds so that its propaganda of education may be
  easily and justly comprehended.</p>

  <p>There is no field for speculation in the analysis of right living. It
  conforms to the law of cause and effect. It is positively concrete in
  substance. A recital of the life history of Jonathan Edwards, in
  comparison with that of the celebrated "Jukes" family, emphasises this
  assumption with a degree of positiveness that is tragic in its
  significance.</p>

  <p>Jonathan Edwards was born in England in Queen Elizabeth's time. He was
  a clergyman and he lived an upright life. So did his wife. His son came
  to the United States, to Hartford, Connecticut, and became an honorable
  merchant. His son, in turn, also became a merchant, upright and honored.
  His son, again, became a minister, and so honored was he that Harvard
  University conferred two degrees on him on the same day; one in the
  morning and one in the afternoon. This learned man again had a son, and
  he became a minister. Jonathan Edwards was his name.</p>

  <p>Now let us see, in 1900, what this one family, started by a man in
  England who lived an upright life and gave that heritage to his children,
  produced: 1,394 descendants of this man have been traced and identified;
  295 were college graduates; 13 were college presidents; 65 were
  professors; 60 were physicians; 108 were clergymen; 101 were lawyers; 30
  were judges; 1 was Vice-President of the United States; 75 were Army and
  Navy <!-- Page xxix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxix"></a>[xxix]</span> officers; 60 were prominent authors; 16
  were railroad and steamship presidents; and in the entire record not one
  has been convicted of a crime.</p>

  <p>Twelve hundred descendants have been traced from the one man who
  founded the "Jukes" family. This record covers a period of seventy-five
  years; out of these, 310 were professional paupers, who spent an
  aggregate of two thousand three hundred years in poorhouses; 50 were evil
  women; 7 were murderers; 60 were habitual thieves; and 130 were common
  criminals.</p>

  <p>It has been estimated that this one family was an economic loss to the
  state, measured in terms of potential usefulness wasted; costs of
  prosecution; expenses of maintenance in jails, hospitals and asylums; and
  of private loss through thefts, and robberies, of $1,300,000 in
  seventy-five years, or more than $1,000 for each member of the
  family.</p>

  <p><i>It would seem to be worth while to be well born, after all.</i></p>

  <p>In order to succeed in the regeneration of the race, we must believe
  that race regeneration is possible, and, that it is worth while. We must
  preach its principles as we would a religion. The power of knowledge is a
  mighty lever. We are living in a period of transition, but we are nearer
  the future than the past.</p>

  <p>We are told by the average individual that it will be impossible to
  arouse the public to an intelligent appreciation of the scope of race
  regeneration. When the writer conceived the happy phrase, "Better
  Babies," a few years ago, he builded better than he knew. It has become
  the slogan of splendid achievement already, and there are a multitude of
  signs and tokens that the propaganda is established on a sure
  foundation.</p>

  <p>If the annihilation of all past civilizations was due to the refusal
  of its members to breed for posterity, may we not reasonably assume that
  we have, according to our statistics, reached the same crisis? If this is
  logical reasoning, and every factor warrants this conclusion, have we not
  reached the time when the perpetuation of the race is the most serious
  question of our times? Is it not a problem for the enthusiastic and
  immediate <!-- Page xxx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxx"></a>[xxx]</span> support of every statesman, politician,
  teacher, and preacher alike? Can any question be of more importance? What
  will our marvelous material splendor avail if the race is destined to
  immediate extinction?</p>

  <p>We need the assistance of every intelligent citizen, we need most, the
  awakening impulse of the mothers of the race. We who are alive are
  responsible for environment and nurture, and we must believe that the
  purpose to be achieved is of supreme importance. Every mother, through
  the power of knowledge, may become a practical eugenist. It is to aid her
  in an intelligent appreciation of the practical intent of the science
  that this work is presented.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE EVOLVED THE
SCIENCE OF EUGENICS</h3>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p><b>Infant Mortality&mdash;Marriage and
  Motherhood&mdash;Heredity&mdash;Environment&mdash;Education&mdash;Disease
  and Vice&mdash;History&mdash;Summary.</b></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There has been evinced during recent years a desire to know something
  more definite about the science of eugenics.</p>

  <p>Eugenics, simply defined, means "better babies." It is the art of
  being well born. It implies consideration of everything that has to do
  with the well-being of the race: motherhood, marriage, heredity,
  environment, disease, hygiene, sanitation, vice, education,
  culture,&mdash;in short, everything upon which the health of the people
  depends. If we contribute the maximum of health to those living, it is
  reasonable to assume that the future generation will profit thereby, and
  "better babies" will be a direct consequence.</p>

  <p>We are frequently told that we must take the world as we find it. This
  has been aptly termed, "the motto of the impotent and cowardly." "Life is
  what we make it," is the more satisfying assertion of the optimist, and
  <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span> most
  of us seem to be trying to make existence more tolerable and more happy.
  It is encouraging to know that intelligent men and women to-day seek an
  opportunity to devote serious consideration to the betterment of the
  race, while yet the pursuit of wealth and pleasure are enticing and
  strenuous occupations.</p>

  <p>It would be superfluous in a book of this character to enter into any
  lengthy explanation as to how the science of eugenics proposes to work
  out its problems. We hope only to excite the interest of mothers in the
  subject, and to instruct them in its rudiments and principles.</p>

  <p>It will be of distinct advantage, however, first to briefly consider
  the conditions,&mdash;which are known to all of us,&mdash;which have led
  up to the present status of the subject.</p>

  <p><b>Infant Mortality.</b>&mdash;No elaborate argument is necessary to
  prove that the present infant mortality, in every civilized country, is
  too high. It is conceded by every authority interested in the subject, no
  matter what explanation he offers, or what system he advances as a
  solution of the problem.</p>

  <p><b>Marriage and Motherhood.</b>&mdash;Every intelligent person knows
  that most young girls enter into the marriage relationship without a real
  understanding of its true meaning, or even a serious thought regarding
  its duties or its responsibilities. We know that their home training in
  domestic science is generally not adequate, and that their educational
  equipment is inefficient. We also know that economic necessity has
  deprived them of the tutelage essential to social progress and physical
  health, and has endowed them with temperamental characteristics
  undesirable in the mothers of the race. Maternity is thrust upon these
  physically and mentally immature young wives, and they assume the
  principal rôle in a relationship that is onerous and exacting. We know
  that the duties of wife and mother require an intelligence which is
  rendered efficient only by maturity and experience. We know that many, if
  not most, young wives acquire habits which undermine their health and
  their morals unwittingly, and we also know that the product <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[3]</span> of this
  inefficiency results in the decadence and the degeneration of the
  race.</p>

  <p><b>Heredity.</b>&mdash;Much remains inexplicable at the present time
  regarding this intensely interesting department of science. We do know,
  however, that its truths are being investigated and tabulated. Our
  present knowledge of its principles has demonstrated the existence of
  laws from which we can ethically deduce explanations of conditions which
  were, in the past, not amenable to any classification. These relate to
  individual and racial characteristics. We are beginning to learn that we
  can modify these characteristics by proper selection, by environment, and
  by education. This process will, to an eminent degree, redound to the
  permanent advantage of mankind. We may reasonably aspire to a system of
  race-culture which will eliminate the undesirable or unfit, and conserve
  all effort in the propagation of the desirable or fit. This is a
  consummation to be desired, and if by any system of eugenics the promise
  of the future is realized it is deserving of the intelligent interest and
  the active coöperation of every aspiring mother.</p>

  <p><b>Environment.</b>&mdash;By environment we mean the provision of
  suitable surroundings in its largest sense. A child to be fit and
  efficient must be born of selected parentage, the home surroundings must
  be desirable, the educational possibilities must be advantageous, the
  sanitary and hygienic conditions must be suitable, opportunities for
  physical and spiritual culture must be provided, and the State must
  ensure justice and the right to achieve success. We know
  that&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;these conditions do not exist. We
  know that the dregs of the human species&mdash;the blind, the deaf-mute,
  the degenerate, the imbecile, the epileptic, the criminal even,&mdash;are
  better protected by organized charity and by the State than are the
  deserving fit and healthy. We know that in the slums thousands of
  desirable children waste their vitality in the battle for existence, and
  we know that, though philanthropy and governmental supervision and
  protection are afforded the deaf, the dumb, the blind and degenerate
  child, no helping hand is held out to save the healthy and efficient
  child, who must pay in disease and <!-- Page 4 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[4]</span> inefficiency the price of
  his normality in degrading toil, in factory and pit, where child labor is
  tolerated. We need the awakening which is the promise of the eugenist,
  that these wrongs will be righted, not by the statesmanship which
  believes that empires are founded and maintained by the power of material
  might, but by a process which will ennoble selected motherhood and give
  to every child born its due and its right.</p>

  <p><b>Education.</b>&mdash;The present system of education is one of the
  great reflections on the intelligence of the human race. One of the
  greatest of contemporary writers has characterized it as "a curse to
  modern childhood and a menace to the future." Even the humblest of
  us&mdash;who would willingly believe the system efficient, who have no
  desire to invite criticism as to our opinion&mdash;are forced to
  acknowledge that there is something wrong with the educational system now
  in vogue. The writer is disposed to believe, however, that the fault is
  not wholly one of art. The conditions with which education has to contend
  are essentially hypothetical. It may be that the laws of heredity and
  psychology, when fixed, will evolve, at least, a more rational and a more
  ethical hypothesis. So far as eugenics is concerned with education, its
  limitation is defined and fixed. If the innate ability is not possessed
  by the child, no system of instruction, and no art of pedagogy, will ever
  draw it out. When the proper material is supplied by an adequate system
  of race culture, science may probably supply the requisite complementary
  data which will ensure an educational system that will really
  educate.</p>

  <p><b>Disease and Vice.</b>&mdash;The eugenic idea is more directly
  concerned with disease which tends to deteriorate the racial type. The
  average parent has no means of adequately estimating the significance of
  this type of disease. It has been estimated that one-half of the total
  effort of one-third of the race is expended in combating conditions
  against which no successful effort is possible. Think what this means.
  The struggle of life is a real struggle, even with success as an
  incentive and as a possible reward. It becomes a tragedy when we think of
  the wasted years, the hopeless prayers and the anguish of those who fight
  <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[5]</span> the
  battle which is predestined to end in apparent failure. We are disposed
  to doubt the justice of the Omnipotent Mind who created us and left us
  seemingly alone&mdash;derelicts in the eddies of eternity.</p>

  <p>This is but a finite fault, however. The truth is that the scheme of
  the universe is unalterable, we are but part of the whole and must share
  in the evolution of the process. An apparent failure is not necessarily a
  discreditable one. Most lives are failures, if appraised by human
  estimate. Take for example the life of a young wife who marries a man
  with disease in his blood. She begins her wedded life with certain
  commendable ideals. She is young, enthusiastic, ambitious, strong, and
  she inherently possesses the right to aspire to become an efficient
  home-maker and a good mother. She gives birth to a child, conceived in
  love, and during her travail she beseeches her Creator to help her and to
  help her baby, as all women do at such a time. Her baby is born blind and
  it is a weak and puny mite. The mother recovers slowly, but she is never
  the same vigorous and ambitious woman. Later her strength fades away, her
  enthusiasm falters, the home is blighted and seems a desecrated spot. The
  baby is a constant worry, it is always sick, it needs expensive care and
  it exhausts the physical remnant of its mother's health. It finally dies
  and is laid away, not forgotten, but a sad, sad memory. The ailing and
  dispirited mother is informed that she must submit to an operation if she
  desires to regain her health, if not to save her life. She returns from
  the hospital&mdash;not a woman&mdash;a blighted thing, an unsexed
  substitute for what once was a happy, sunny, healthy, innocent girl.</p>

  <p>This is not an overdrawn tale,&mdash;it is a true story, a common,
  every-day story. Who was to blame? Why were her prayers not heard? Why,
  indeed? One might as well ask why seemingly splendid civilizations
  decayed into forgotten dust, or why empires rotted away. The answer is
  the same.</p>

  <p><b>History.</b>&mdash;From the eugenists' standpoint history is
  prolific only in negation. A correct interpretation of its pages teaches
  us that it has not taught the lesson of the "survival of the fittest,"
  but rather the survival of the <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>[6]</span> strongest. That the strongest is not always
  the "fittest" needs no commentary. That the fit should survive is the
  genetic law of nature, and it has been strictly obeyed by biology and
  humanity when these sciences have adhered to, and have been under the
  jurisdiction of the natural law.</p>

  <p>When religious schisms swayed the world, the stronger party, in
  material strength or in actual numbers, massacred the weaker, which was
  frequently the fitter from the standpoint of desirability as progenitors
  of the race. Thus posterity was deprived of what probably was the
  representative, potential strength of generations.</p>

  <p>At a later date religious schism changed her <i>modus operandi</i> but
  accomplished the same pernicious purpose, as the following shows:</p>

  <p>"Whenever a man or woman was possessed of a gentle nature that fitted
  him or her to deeds of charity, to meditation, to literature or to art,
  the social condition of the time was such that they had no refuge
  elsewhere than in the bosom of the Church. But the Church chose to preach
  and exact celibacy, and the consequence was that these gentle natures had
  no continuance, and thus, by a policy, was brutalized the breed of our
  forefathers."</p>

  <p>When religion was not the dominating power, mankind was ruled by
  militant tyrants. The non-elect were slaves,&mdash;uneducated,
  uncivilized, debased and diseased. The elect were licentious and
  indolent. Neither class practised any domestic virtues, or respected the
  institution of motherhood. The process of the selection of the fittest
  for survival for the purpose of parentage, and for the consummation of
  the evolutionary gradation, through which the human race is apparently
  destined to pass, was again in abeyance for a series of generations.</p>

  <p>In our own times, the fate of nations and the destiny of their people
  would seem to depend upon the size of the fighting force and the
  efficiency of the ships we build; our ability to dicker and barter, to
  gain a questionable commercial supremacy, and the loquaciousness of our
  politicians. This, at least, is the criterion upon which the modern
  statesman estimates the quality of <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span> present-day civilization.
  He is not apparently interested in the story of the ages. The progress of
  God's supernal scheme through æons of bigotry and darkness neither
  suggests nor inspires in him a loftier constructive analysis. He is
  content to leave the destiny of nations to tons of material, tons of men
  and tons of talk.</p>

  <p>Nowhere do we find any reference to the quality of the blood-stream of
  the people. Nor does it seem to have been discovered by those who wield
  authority, that the glory of a nation depends upon its brains, not its
  bulk; nor do they apprehend that the greatness of a people is not in its
  past history, but in its ever-existing motherhood; and that its battles,
  in the future, must be fought, not on battlefields, but in its nurseries.
  When we judge our national worth and wealth by the quality of our
  maternal material, and estimate our greatness and our glory by the record
  of our infant mortality, we will have carved an enduring niche in the
  celestial scheme that will be unchangeable and for all time.</p>

  <p>There are in Britain to-day over a million and a quarter females of
  marriageable age in excess of the number of marriageable males. A war
  between Britain and Germany would unquestionably be the bloodiest war in
  all history, and it probably would be the last one, because it would only
  end in the dominance of one power over all the others. If we concern
  ourselves only with Britain&mdash;from the eugenic standpoint&mdash;who
  would dare compute the ratio of marriageable females over the males after
  the war was over? The consequence of such a war on posterity would be
  tragic. It would mean the annihilation of the fittest for fatherhood for
  generations. Only the unfit would be left from which to begin a new
  breed.</p>

  <p>The multitude of females who would necessarily be left unable to
  participate in the highest function of womanhood would have to be
  self-supporting. The economic problem would, therefore, have a
  far-reaching influence and even if solved adequately as an economic
  problem, it could never be solved satisfactorily as a sociological, or as
  a problem in eugenics.</p>

  <p>Infant mortality is too high. Apart from the <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span> statistical proof which
  shows it, we may rightly construe as further proof of it, the widespread
  effort being made in every civilized country in the world to ameliorate
  the condition.</p>

  <p>The laws and ethics of marriage are inadequate. Its true purpose is
  frustrated and racial and individual injustice and imperfection are the
  products of existing conditions.</p>

  <p>Motherhood, in its every aspect is not, and has not in the past, been
  elevated to the plane which a true estimate of its supreme importance to
  the race justifies.</p>

  <p>Heredity as a scientific principle is undeveloped, and because of
  maladministration in past generations, the present generation is
  endeavoring to do the work, the fruits of which it should be
  enjoying.</p>

  <p>Environment in its highest sense is impossible because of inadequate
  laws, imperfect hygienic and sanitary knowledge, incomplete education,
  vice and disease.</p>

  <p>If there was not some supremely important, cardinal error somewhere,
  it is reasonable to suppose that in one or other of the departments of
  human effort we would have reached the summit of idealism. The State, as
  an institution, would have evolved a perfection which would enable it to
  exist as an independent mechanism, complete and ideal in all its
  ramifications. We have had no such state, however. The highest type of
  empire has been ludicrously dependent upon the minor exigencies of
  individual human existence.</p>

  <p>Science would have evolved the superman, but history, as we have seen,
  has persistently deprived science of the material wherewith to contribute
  him.</p>

  <p>The institution of marriage would have been a fixed and an inviolable
  guarantee of the happiness of the home, but human wisdom has erred and
  the solution is as yet apparently undiscovered.</p>

  <p>Investigation into every field of human effort shows that the ultimate
  aim in view, if any, was something other than the welfare of the race, as
  a race or as individuals.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The eugenist believes the cardinal error of the past has been a
  failure to recognize the worth or value of human life. In the past human
  lives have counted for absolutely nothing. As we have seen, each
  generation has practically deprived posterity of the best of its breed,
  and we shall see, when we consider the facts which affect the present
  vitality of the race, that the same preposterous conditions still
  exist.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to waste the reader's time in an effort to prove,
  simply from an argumentative standpoint, the logic of the eugenic idea.
  There is no existing economic problem that has established itself so
  firmly in the hearts of the people who understand it, as has the study of
  race culture. It is not the subject, but its scope of application, that
  is new. Biologically, we see the manifestations of eugenics on every
  side. In the flower garden we breed for beauty, in the orchard for
  quality. In the poultry yard and on the stock farm the same process weeds
  out the unfit and cultivates the desirable. The value of the eugenic idea
  is most strikingly illustrated in the cultivation, or breeding, of the
  horse from a primitive creature into the splendid animals which represent
  the various types of equine present-day <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span> perfection. It has taken
  generations of the most painstaking intelligence to understand the traits
  which had to be evolved in scientific mating to reach the present
  standard. If the same rules, or lack of rules, applied to the mating of
  horses as applied to ourselves, there would be few, if any,
  "thoroughbreds" among them. The principle which we must recognize is that
  "Life is the only wealth."</p>

  <p>Progress and efficiency will be ensured and of an enduring character,
  when all human effort is consecrated to this fundamental principle as a
  basic law, and not till then.</p>

  <p>To cultivate the human race on prescribed scientific principles will
  be the supreme science of all the future, the object and the final goal
  of all honest governmental jurisprudence, and the ultimate judge of all
  true constructive legislation.</p>

<h4>THE EUGENIC PRINCIPLE</h4>

  <p>The eugenic principle is, that "the fit only shall live." This does
  not mean that the unfit must die, but that only the fit shall be born.
  Occasionally, as a product of bad environment, or faulty training, or
  eccentricity, a horse gives evidence of vicious traits, but the
  scientific breeder never mates him. He is allowed to die out. If he were
  permitted to father a race, his progeny would develop murderous
  characteristics that would retard the type for generations.</p>

  <p><b>The Fit Only Shall Be Born.</b>&mdash;This implies the exclusion of
  those, as parents, who are incapable of creating fit children. Fit
  children are children who are physically and mentally healthy. Parents
  who are unfit to create physically and mentally healthy children are
  those diseased in body or mind, especially if the disease is of the type
  which science has proved to be transmissible, or which directly affects
  the vitality of the child. In such a category we place those who are
  deaf, dumb, blind, epileptic, feeble-minded, insane, criminal,
  consumptive, cancerous, haemophilic, syphilitic, or drunkards, and <!--
  Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span> those
  known to be victims of disease of any other special type.</p>

  <p>It must not be inferred that the above classification is made
  arbitrarily. There are many arguments which may be advanced limiting the
  eugenic applicability of certain of these diseased conditions. These,
  however, do not directly come within the province of the mother. They may
  be safely left to special state regulation. We simply make the assertion
  that no mother would willingly, or designedly, ally her offspring with
  any member of society afflicted with any of the diseases enumerated.</p>

  <p><b>Eugenics and Marriage.</b>&mdash;The eugenic idea, practically
  applied to the institution of marriage, means that no unfit person will
  be allowed to marry. It will be necessary for each applicant to pass a
  medical examination as to his, or her, physical and mental fitness. This
  is eminently a just decree. It will not only be a competent safeguard
  against marriage with those obviously diseased and incompetent, but it
  will render impossible marriage with those afflicted with undetected or
  secret disease. Inasmuch as the latter type of disease is the foundation
  for most of the failures in marriage, and for most of the ills and
  tragedies in the lives of women, it is essential to devote special
  consideration to it in the interest of the mothers of the race.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that there are more than ten million victims of
  venereal disease in the United States to-day. In New York City alone
  there are two million men and women&mdash;not including boys and girls
  from six to twelve years of age&mdash;actively suffering from gonorrhea
  and syphilis. Eight out of every ten young men, between seventeen and
  thirty years of age, are suffering directly or indirectly from the
  effects of these diseases, and a very large percentage of these cases
  will be conveyed to wife and children and will wreck their lives. No one
  but a physician can have the faintest conception of the far-reaching
  consequences of infection of this character. The great White Plague is
  merely an incident compared to it. These diseases are largely responsible
  for our blind children, for the feeble-minded, for the degenerate and
  criminal, the incompetent and the insane. No other <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[12]</span> disease can approximate
  syphilis in its hideous influence upon parenthood and the future. The
  women of the race, and particularly the mothers, should fully appreciate
  the real significance of the situation as it applies to them
  individually. That they do not appreciate it is well known to every
  physician and surgeon.</p>

  <p>It is first necessary to state certain medical facts regarding these
  diseases. They exist for years after all symptoms have disappeared; no
  evidences exist even to suggest to the patient that he, or she, is not
  entirely cured. After the germs have been in the patient for some time
  they lose a certain degree of their virility, and a condition of immunity
  is established. In other words the tissue ceases to be a favorable medium
  for the development, or activity, of the germs. If these germs, however,
  are conveyed to another person, who has never had the disease, or whose
  tissue is not immune, they will immediately resume their full activity
  and virulence, and will establish the disease, frequently in its most
  violent form, in the person so infected. The startling deduction which we
  must draw from these facts is, that a man may infect his wife, and may
  thereby be the direct cause of wrecking her entire life, and may, in
  addition, as a consequence of the infection, cause a child to be born
  blind, without even remotely suspecting that he is in any way responsible
  for it. In the light of this knowledge, what is the percentage risk a
  young girl takes when she selects a husband, remembering that eight out
  of every ten husbands bring these germs to the marriage bed? Reread the
  true story of the young woman on page <a href="#page5">five</a>, accept
  my assurance that there are thousands and thousands of such cases, and
  ask yourself, who is to blame? We may certainly assure ourselves that no
  man living would wilfully desecrate his bride. He did not know,&mdash;did
  not even suspect that the disease he had years ago was still in his
  system. Society is to blame&mdash;you and I&mdash;the laxity of the law
  is the culprit. Had he been compelled to pass a physical examination
  before marriage he would have been told the truth.</p>

  <p>It is a notorious fact, that in every civilized city in the world, the
  number of operations that are daily performed <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[13]</span> on women, is increasing
  appallingly. Every surgeon knows that nine-tenths of these operations are
  caused, directly or indirectly, by these diseases, and in almost every
  case in married women, they are obtained innocently from their own
  husbands. It is rare to find a married woman who is not suffering from
  some ovarian or uterine trouble, or some obscure nervous condition, which
  is not amenable to the ordinary remedies, and a very large percentage of
  these cases are primarily caused by infection obtained in the same
  way.</p>

  <p>When a girl marries she does not know what fate has in store for her,
  nor is there any possible way of knowing under the present marriage
  system. If she begets a sickly, puny child,&mdash;assuming she herself
  has providentially escaped immediate disease,&mdash;she devotes all her
  mother love and devotion to it, but she is fighting a hopeless fight, as
  I previously explained when I stated that one-half of the total effort of
  one-third of the race is expended in combating conditions against which
  no successful effort is possible. Even her prayers are futile, because
  the wrong is implanted in the constitution of the child, and the remedy
  is elsewhere. These are the tragedies of life, which no words can
  adequately describe, and compared to which the incidental troubles of the
  world are as nothing.</p>

  <p>So long as these conditions exist need we not tremble for the future
  of the race? Is not this future welfare a personal issue, or can we trust
  the future of our daughters to the same indiscriminate fate that has
  written the pages of history in the past?</p>

  <p>This problem has been debated from every possible angle without our
  reaching any seemingly practical solution. The promise of emancipation,
  however, came with the dawn of eugenics. It is the only solution that
  gives promise of immediate and reasonable success. For that reason alone
  it should receive the active support of every good mother in all
  lands.</p>

  <p><b>The Utility of Marriage Certificates.</b>&mdash;There would seem to
  be no question as to the utility of marriage certificates. We must
  remember, however, that there is a distinction between marriage and
  parenthood, and that <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[14]</span> eugenics is concerned only with parenthood.
  It is interested in the institution of marriage to the extent only that
  it may, by some system of regulation, be a positive and fixed factor in
  the production of exclusively healthy children. The eugenist demands fit
  children. If society can ensure fit children, as a consequence of any
  marriage system which may or may not include medical certification, the
  eugenic aim is fully met. At the present time the giving of a marriage
  certificate, which is really a permit to marry, would seem to be the most
  practical way promptly to accomplish the eugenic purpose. We should
  promptly question the honor of any prospective husband disposed to evade
  the examination simply because he was not compelled to obey by a
  legislative enactment.</p>

  <p>We believe that when the public is educated to the truth and intent of
  eugenics, there need be no compulsory examination. Men and women will, of
  their own accord, desire to know if their marriage will jeopardize the
  race. There will be questions of heredity to elucidate, questions of
  inherited insanity, poison taints, of blindness and deafness, or it may
  be of drunkenness.</p>

  <p>Further, marriage certificates, or permits, must be considered in
  regard to the future conduct of those to whom we refuse permits to marry.
  A refusal of the permission to marry will not change the desire to marry.
  Many, of course, to whom a permit is refused, will accept the situation,
  will be thankful to be possessed of the knowledge of their incompetency
  in order that they may seek medical aid. These individuals will remain
  under medical supervision until their ailments are cured and their
  competency established. In this way the eugenic aim is materially
  furthered. Others may not abide by the decree which forbids marriage. It
  would wholly defeat the eugenic idea if the unfit children were to
  continue to be born illegitimately. These individuals will comprise the
  few&mdash;probably the present unfit members of society&mdash;and the
  final solution of the matter must remain a question of education and
  evolution. When public opinion is educated to the degree necessary to
  establish a system of eugenic self-protection, we shall be <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[15]</span> provided with a
  race of children whose culture will achieve the ideal of parenthood by a
  process of education rather than legislation.</p>

  <p><b>The Marriage Certificate and Vice.</b>&mdash;If a prenuptial
  examination were made compulsory there is no doubt of the very prompt and
  salutory effect it would have on present-day vice. It has often been said
  that "You cannot legislate virtue or sobriety into a people." We are
  familiar too with the maxim that "You can lead a horse to the well, but
  you cannot make him drink." You can lead a horse to the well, however,
  and lo! he drinks. If you lead him at the right time he will always
  drink. If we legislate at the psychological moment we can legislate
  virtue and sobriety into a people.</p>

  <p>A very large percentage of existing vice is the immediate product of
  ignorance, and the larger percentage of the remainder is the result of
  propinquity and the idea that it will never be found out. Very little of
  it is the outcome of innate degeneracy. It is an acquired degeneracy we
  must guard against, and that is the special educational motive of
  eugenics. Young men will be taught the truth about vice, and if they have
  been victims in the past, they will willingly submit themselves to a
  <i>competent</i> investigation of their fitness for marriage. If they are
  still pure, the desire to remain so, in order to be eligible for
  parenthood, will guard them against the risk of contamination. This will
  not only result in a distinct improvement of the moral tone, but the
  potential possibilities to posterity will be incalculable. Legislation
  might therefore be the vehicle through which eugenic education could
  enlighten and evolve a fit race.</p>

<h4>EUGENICS AND PARENTHOOD</h4>

  <p>If the supreme end is a better race we must recognize that the great
  need for society to-day is to educate for parenthood. History teaches
  that a civilization that dissipates its virility in profligacy or spends
  its energy in political and commercial trickery, and gives no thought to
  the character of the men and women it produces, is destined to total
  failure. Parenthood and birth&mdash;in these <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[16]</span> we have the eugenic
  instruments of the future. The only permanent way to cure the ills of the
  world is to prevent the multiplication of people below a certain
  standard. The elevation and the actual preservation of the race depends
  upon rendering it impossible for the unfit coming into existence at all.
  In other words the unfit or unworthy must be rejected, not necessarily as
  individuals, but as parents.</p>

  <p>Eugenics is allied to the principle of heredity,&mdash;the principle
  that enables us to modify conditions so as to ensure the right children
  being born. The propaganda against infant mortality is directed only
  toward the provision of a good environment,&mdash;so that children, when
  born, may survive and attain the maximum of their hereditary promise. The
  two campaigns are essentially complementary. The one applies only before
  birth, the other after birth. The statistics of infant mortality
  unfortunately show that it is not a process that extinguishes the unfit
  only. The healthy succumb to unfavorable environment and it was to amend
  this condition that the campaign against infant mortality was undertaken.
  The two campaigns appeal to the same creed: that parenthood is the
  supreme function of the race, that it must not be indifferently
  undertaken; that it demands the most careful preparation; that it is a
  duty which can only be carried out eugenically by the highest attainable
  health of body and mind and emotions.</p>

  <p><b>Eugenics and Motherhood.</b>&mdash;Any plan or scheme which has for
  its object race regeneration must concern itself with the health, the
  education, and the psychology of woman; the environment which shall
  surround her period of motherhood, and her selection of the fathers of
  the future. Society must safeguard her in all her relations. The race
  to-morrow are the babies of to-day. The wealth of a nation therefore is
  the type of baby that will constitute its civilization from generation to
  generation, and absolutely nothing else counts. We hear much about race
  suicide, but is it not monstrous to cry for more babies when we do not
  know how to keep alive those we have? It is a fact that everywhere the
  birth rate of the Caucasian people is on the decline. Our birth <!-- Page
  17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>[17]</span> rate as a
  whole, however, is ample; it is the death rate that is significant and
  appalling. When we remember that one-third of all the babies born die
  before they reach the age of five years; and that the deaths of babies
  under one year of age comprise about one-fourth of the total death-roll;
  and that fully one-half of all these deaths are needless and unnecessary,
  wherein is the wisdom of working for a higher birth rate if it is merely
  that more may die?</p>

  <p>The majority of babies are born physically healthy, but because of our
  destructive process, we proceed to annihilate hundreds of thousands of
  them yearly, and because of defective environment and education we render
  thousands of others, including the fit and unfit, inefficient and
  incompetent as propagating factors. It is to remove this disastrous
  stigma on our intelligence that we have been forced to study the
  conditions which the eugenic idea represents. When these principles are
  understood and believed, and when they are acted upon, infant mortality
  will cease to exist.</p>

  <p>It was the design of the Creator that human motherhood should be an
  exalted occupation. He placed in her care to nurture and to love, the
  most helpless living thing. Few have regarded a baby from this viewpoint
  and fewer still understand its supreme significance. That it is the most
  utterly helpless thing possessing life is a self-evident fact, and that
  it should be destined to be King of all mammalian tribes as well as Lord
  of all the earth is a superlative paradox. Because of its utter inability
  to care for itself it is more in need of care than any other
  representative of the animal world. It is not only in need of immediate
  care, but it demands care longer than the young of any other species.</p>

  <p>It stands to reason, therefore, that the function of motherhood must
  be reckoned with in any scheme of race regeneration; that it must be
  provided with the most favorable environment; and that it must be
  relieved of any condition which would materially retard the meeting of
  the obligation to its fullest possible extent. In an ideal eugenic sense
  the state must ensure sustenance to those deprived of ample food and
  raiment, and science <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>[18]</span> must continue to solve the problem of a
  fitter sanitary and hygienic environment for the congested and densely
  populated zones of habitation. Philanthropy must not continue to be
  wholly misdirected, it must extend its aid to the deserving healthy and
  fit, as well as to be exclusively the protecting agency of the diseased
  and unfit. If life is the only wealth, and the preservation of childhood
  the highest duty of society and the state,&mdash;which it would seem to
  be, since the continuance and preservation of the race is obviously
  essential to the continuance of the state itself,&mdash;the life of every
  child must be considered an economic as well as a moral trust. If,
  therefore, every child is sacred, every mother is equally sacred. If
  every child is to be cared for, every mother must be cared for. If the
  state cannot afford to provide for what is imperatively essential to its
  own continuance, it might as well go out of existence, as it inevitably
  will in the end on any other basis, and as all preceding states have
  done.</p>

  <p>Mothers must not be dependent upon their children's labor for their
  maintenance, because if children are compelled to work, they will not be
  able to work in the future,&mdash;and adult efficiency is necessary to
  the well-being of the individual, the race, and the state.</p>

  <p>No mother should work, because in the care of her children she is
  already doing the supreme work. The proper care of children is so
  continuous and exacting a task, and of such importance to posterity, that
  it must be regarded as the highest and foremost work&mdash;and adequate
  in itself&mdash;and its efficiency must not be hampered by mothers having
  to do anything else.</p>

  <p>Motherhood must not be financially insecure, because this would defeat
  its eugenic purpose. Society, therefore, as a matter of
  self-preservation, must ensure to woman her mental and economic security.
  Civilization's margin is large enough to provide this. We spend large
  amounts on luxuries and evils which are contrary to the genesis of
  self-preservation, while motherhood is its basic necessity. When public
  opinion is educated in the essentials of eugenics much of this can be,
  and will be diverted to a nobler purpose. The total cost <!-- Page 19
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span> necessary to
  ensure the adequate care of dependent motherhood would be a mere fraction
  of the national expenditure, and not a tithe of what we spend in pension
  allowances yearly. The latter is regarded as an honorable debt and is at
  best the direct product of a decadent ideal, while motherhood constitutes
  the very germ of the only altruistic idealism for all the future.</p>

  <p>We concede, therefore, that the children and the mothers must be
  provided for, not only as a product of the true construction of the
  ethics of sociology, but in obedience to the fundamental law of a moral
  system of eugenics. We must go further and assert that children must be
  cared for through the mother. It has been the practice to divorce the
  improvident mother from her dependent children. This has been
  demonstrated to be not only an altruistic fallacy. It has proved to be an
  economic blunder.</p>

  <p>There is another type of evil which largely menaces the eugenic ideal
  of motherhood. It is those cases where married women who have children
  are compelled to be the bread winners of the family as well as its
  mothers. No woman can earn support for herself and children outside of
  her home and competently assume the responsibilities of motherhood at the
  same time. Whatever aid a mother renders to the state, as a result of
  effort in factory or shop, is of infinitely less value, from an economic
  standpoint, than her contribution as mother in caring for her own
  children in her own home. A careful study of infant mortality, and the
  conditions of child life, so far as survival value is concerned, condemns
  in the strongest and most vital sense this whole practice. The
  preservation of the race is the essential requisite, and it is the vital
  industry of any people. Any seeming economic necessity which destroys
  that industry is one that will contribute largely to the downfall of the
  people as a race.</p>

  <p><b>Eugenics and the Husband.</b>&mdash;The question of the husband's
  moral and parental obligation, as dictated by the marriage institution
  and constitution, may be left out of this discussion. We may assert,
  however, that we do not believe the eugenic principle intends, in
  devising ways <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>[20]</span> and means for the adequate protection, in
  its completest sense, of motherhood, to relieve the father of any of his
  moral or parental obligations. These obligations will be justly defined,
  and as previously stated, will be the subject of special state
  legislation. No legislation of an economic character can detract from the
  performance of a moral obligation, and by no process of sophistication
  can modern statesmanship accomplish the dethronement of motherhood. The
  duty of the father is to support his children and the mother of his
  children, and the duty of the state is to see that this is done. The
  fundamental law of the eugenist must be to recognize that fatherhood is a
  deliberate and responsible act, for which a fixed accountability must be
  maintained. Whatever legislation is undertaken in this connection must be
  with the object in view of strengthening the efforts of the right kind of
  father and husband, and of rendering more difficult the path of the
  irresponsible father and husband. If the supreme duty of a state is the
  maintenance of justice, its whole effort in the future will be to
  legislate in harmony with the eugenic principle.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The fundamental law of eugenics demands that all education be exerted
  for parenthood. We have proved that the child is not only essential to
  the life of the state, but is the state. Consequently any function other
  than parenthood is a non-essential so far as organic existence is
  dependent upon it. Education can, therefore, have no higher or more
  righteous motive than as a contributory agency in the perpetuation of the
  function upon which all existence depends. If the only function of
  education is to make one a worthy citizen, or to make him, or her,
  self-supporting, or able to bear arms in defense of his country, rather
  than a perfect link in the complete chain of enduring life, its purpose
  is being perverted. It is not sufficient to provide a girl, for instance,
  with an exclusive environment which regards her simply as a muscular
  entity, as is the tendency in some of the "best" girls' schools to-day;
  nor to fit her as a domestic or society ornament; nor must she be
  regarded simply as an intellectual machine, as is done under the system
  styled "the higher education of women." Any one of these is <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span> an example of
  misdirected excess and is only part of the whole. None of these systems
  strives to develop the emotional side of the complex female character,
  and any educational system which ignores the emotions is not only
  inadequate but reprehensible in the highest degree. The ideal which will
  strive for education for ultimate parenthood will more completely solve
  the question of complete (eugenic) living.</p>

  <p><b>The Present Educational System is Inadequate.</b>&mdash;There is no
  question that education, as conducted at the present time, is one of the
  most disastrous institutional fallacies of modern civilization. In
  support of this contention, we are prompted to quote at length from
  various authorities bearing on this subject.</p>

  <p>Dr. C. W. Saleeby, an international authority on education, writes as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"A simple analogy will show the disastrous character of the present
  process, which may be briefly described as 'education' by cram and
  emetic. It is as if you filled a child's stomach to repletion with
  marbles, pieces of coal and similar material incapable of
  digestion&mdash;the more worthless the material the more accurate the
  analogy&mdash;then applied an emetic and estimated your success by the
  completeness with which everything was returned, more especially if it
  was returned 'unchanged,' as the doctors say. Just so do we cram the
  child's mental stomach, its memory, with a selection of dead facts of
  history and the like (at least when they are not fictions) and then apply
  a violent emetic called an examination (which like most other emetics
  causes much depression) and estimate our success by the number of
  statements which the child vomits onto the examination paper&mdash;if the
  reader will excuse me. Further, if we are what we usually are, we prefer
  that the statements shall come back 'unchanged'&mdash;showing no sign of
  mental digestion. We call this 'training the memory.' The present type of
  education is a curse to modern childhood and a menace to the future. The
  teacher who cannot tell whether a child is doing well without formally
  examining it, should be heaving bricks, but such a teacher does not
  exist. In Berlin they are now learning that the depression caused <!--
  Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span> by
  these emetics (examinations) often lead to child suicide&mdash;a steadily
  increasing phenomenon mainly due to educational overpressure and worry
  about examinations.</p>

  <p>"Short of such appalling disasters, however, we have to reckon with
  the existence of this enormous amount of stupidity, which those who
  fortunately escaped such education in childhood have to drag along with
  them in the long struggle towards the stars. This dead weight of inertia
  lamentably retards progress.</p>

  <p>"If you have been treated with marbles and emetics long enough, you
  may begin to question whether there is such a <ins class="correction"
  title="'think' (hand-corrected) in original">thing</ins> as nourishing
  food; if you have been crammed with dead facts, and then compelled to
  disgorge them, you may well question whether there are such things as
  nourishing facts or ideas."</p>

  <p>The gifted writer, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in an editorial in the <i>New
  York American</i>, expressed herself recently in the following terms:</p>

  <p>"A wave of dissatisfaction is sweeping over the country regarding our
  school system. And eventually this will cause a change to be made. The
  larger understanding of mothers regarding education will result in the
  personal element entering into the training of children.</p>

  <p>"When women have a voice in the affairs of the nation there will be
  more teachers, larger salaries, fewer pupils in each department, and more
  attention will be given to the temperaments and varying dispositions of
  children by their instructors.</p>

  <p>"Instead of regarding the little ones who enter public schools as
  machines which must be taught to go according to one rule, each child
  will be studied as a threefold being, and his mind, body and spirit will
  be cared for and developed according to his own peculiar needs. All this
  will come slowly, but it will come.</p>

  <p>"Before children enter the public schools there should be a great
  sifting process under the direction of a national board of scientific
  men. The brain equipment of each child, the tendencies given it at birth,
  should be tested; then the nervous, hysterical and erratic minds <!--
  Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span> ought
  to be placed in a school by themselves, under the care of men and women
  who know the law of mental suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Quiet, loving, wholesome rules, followed day after day and month
  after month, would bring these children out into the light of
  self-control and concentration. The hurried, crowding, exciting methods
  of the public schools are disastrous to fully half of the unformed minds
  sent into the intellectual maelstrom which America provides under the
  name of Public Schools.</p>

  <p>"For the well-born, normal-minded, healthy-bodied child, who has wise
  and careful guardians or parents to assist in his mental guidance, the
  public school forms a good basis on which to build an education. For the
  average American child of excitable nerves and precocious tendencies, it
  is like deep surf swimming for the inexperienced and adventurous
  bather.</p>

  <p>"The great foundation of education&mdash;character&mdash;is not taught
  in the public schools. There is no systematized process of developing a
  child's power of concentration; there is not time for this in the
  cramming process now in vogue and with the enormous pressure placed on
  teachers. No teacher can do justice to more than fifteen children through
  the school hours. In many of our public schools there are fifty and sixty
  children under one instructor. This is fatal to the nervous system of the
  teacher and deprives the pupils of that personal sympathy which is of
  such vital importance."</p>

  <p>Luther Burbank, the famous California horticulturist, declares that
  the great object and aim of his life is to apply to the training of
  children those scientific ideas which he has so successfully employed in
  working transformation in plant life.</p>

  <p>In an editorial, entitled, "Teaching Health," the <i>New York
  Globe</i> states, "Anatomy and physiology are reasonably exact sciences,
  and nine-tenths of the hygienic abuses against which the doctors are
  preaching would be prevented if the laity had an elementary knowledge of
  physiology. Such an educational reform could be carried out without
  causing any clash whatever between the warring medical sects." <!-- Page
  25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span></p>

  <p>William D. Lewis, Principal of the William Penn School, Philadelphia,
  in an article entitled: "The High School and the Girl," in a recent issue
  of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, wrote in part as follows:</p>

  <p>... "The first thing that society wants of our girl is good health.
  This is the first essential for her efficient service and personal
  happiness in shop, office, store, school or home. The future of the race
  so far as she represents it, depends upon her health. What is the high
  school doing to improve the girl's health? In the overwhelming majority
  of cases absolutely nothing. On the other hand, it is subjecting her to a
  regimen planned for boys, without the slightest consideration of the
  physical and functional differences between the sexes.</p>

  <p>"It pays no attention to the curvature of the spine developed by the
  exclusively sit-at-a-desk-and-study-a-book type of education bequeathed
  to the girlhood of the nation by the medieval monastery: It ignores the
  chorea, otherwise known as St. Vitus' dance developed by overstudy and
  underexercise; it disregards the malnutrition of hasty breakfasts, and
  lunches of pickles, fudge, cream-puffs and other kickshaws, not to
  mention the catch penny trash too often provided by the janitor or
  concessionaire of the school luncheon, who isn't doing business for his
  health or for anybody else's; it neglects eye-strain, unhygienic dress,
  uncleanly habits, anemia, periodic headaches, nervousness, adenoids, and
  wrong habits of posture and movements.... If you believe that the high
  school is a social institution with a mission of public service,
  regardless of the relation of that service to Latin or Algebra, then you
  must agree that it should look after what everyone recognizes as the
  foremost need of the adolescent girl.</p>

  <p>"One fact that every educator in both camps knows is that the home is
  not attending to the health of the adolescent girl. This problem is
  pressing upon us now largely because of the revolutions in living
  conditions that has come within the last quarter of a century."</p>

  <p>In a report of a recent Conference on the <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[26]</span> Conservation of School
  Children held at Lehigh University by the American Academy of Medicine,
  the following items appear.</p>

  <p>Four great reasons why medical inspection in schools is needed were
  brought out by Dr. Thomas A. Story of New York, who spoke from the
  educator's standpoint:</p>

  <p>"The first reason is concerned with communicable diseases, and the
  second with remediable incapacitating physical defects. It was reported
  in 1906 that over twenty per cent. of the children in the schools of New
  York City had defective vision, and over fifty per cent. had defective
  teeth. These defective conditions are amenable to treatment whereby the
  functional efficiency of the pupil is improved. He is capable of better
  work and the school efficiency is advanced.</p>

  <p>"The third reason is concerned with irremediable physical defects. The
  cripples, the deformed and the delinquents whose incapacitating defects
  are permanent should be found and classified. This enables special
  instruction and opens up educational possibilities otherwise
  unattainable, besides removing retarding factors in the progress of the
  normal pupil.</p>

  <p>"The fourth reason is concerned with the development of hygienic
  habits in the school child, and through the child, of the community.
  Medical inspection which influences the health habits of the masses is a
  matter of supreme importance. The teacher will have pupils of cleaner
  habits and healthier, with fewer interruptions and disturbances from
  absences.</p>

  <p>"To make medical inspection successful physical examinations should
  uncover the anatomic, physiologic, and hygienic conditions. Every piece
  of advice given to a pupil that can be followed up should be followed up
  and the result recorded. No system of medical inspection in schools can
  be complete and permanently successful which does not eventually educate
  the parent and child to a sympathetic and coöperative relationship with
  the system. Medical inspection is a force working for a better general
  education in personal hygiene and should coördinate with the class room
  instruction. Hence it <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span> must be a system in sympathetic
  relationship with the general management of the school, and should be
  under the same responsible control. Since it is an educational influence
  and so directly related to the success of the school, it ought to be a
  part of the school organization."</p>

  <p>A paper was read by Dr. Helen C. Putnam of Providence, R. I., on "The
  Teaching of Hygiene for Better Parentage." She said:</p>

  <p>"Life is a trust from fathers and mothers beginning before history; to
  be guarded and bettered in one's turn, and passed along to children's
  children. A definite conception of this trust is essential to right
  living. Educators are finding that well directed correlation of human
  life, with phenomena of growing things in school gardens and nature
  studies, develops a wholesome mental attitude. Since tens of millions of
  our population have only fractions of primary schooling, there is where
  the teaching must begin. These primary years are the time to lay
  foundations before a wrong bias is established.</p>

  <p>"Education for parenthood cannot be completed at this early age. The
  strategic years for making it most effective are from sixteen to
  twenty-four, when home-making instincts are waking and strongest. We have
  15,000,000 young people of these ages in no schools, and eligible for
  such instruction. All state boards of education were recently petitioned
  by the American Association for Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality
  to urge the appointment of commissions on continuation schools of
  home-making, to investigate conditions and needs in their respective
  states and to report plans for meeting them effectively through such
  continuation schools or classes."</p>

  <p><b>Difficulty in Devising a Satisfactory Educational
  System.</b>&mdash;It will be observed that each of these authoritative
  writers criticises the system of education now in vogue. The criticism is
  not, nor could it justly be, specialized. It is simply an expression,
  from different viewpoints, of the feeling that we are not doing ourselves
  justice as yet, we are groping after something better. It <!-- Page 28
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span> may be, as I
  have previously stated, that no satisfactory system of education will be
  evolved until the laws of kindred sciences, which have organic
  relationship to what we understand as education, are fixed and better
  understood. We are just beginning to appreciate the true meaning of
  environment. We know little about heredity, but enough to appreciate its
  vital importance. Psychology is a realm of much hope, but we have only
  tasted of its surface promise and know little of the mysteries it may
  unfold. Eugenics, the infant giant of science, promises to establish the
  race on an enduring foundation. These sciences have laws which we do not
  yet understand; they relate to that part of human evolution which mind
  dominates. The quality of the mind's dominion depends upon the mind's
  education and environment, and since the laws of these sciences, upon
  which a perfect system of education depends, have not been revealed, it
  is quite evident that all past systems of education have been more or
  less deficient. It is further evident that evolution has suffered as a
  result of the mind's imperfect education,&mdash;a condition that is
  manifest all around us.</p>

  <p>It must be appreciated, however, that we are discussing a large
  subject. If we understood all there is to know about environment; if we
  knew the laws of heredity, and psychology, and eugenics, and then could
  apply them, and educate the product of this combination of forces, we
  would be very near to the super-man. One must have a sober mental horizon
  to evolve the picture which would be the product of the above solution
  and then to estimate its meaning on human happiness and progress. We are
  approaching the ethics of right living,&mdash;of justice and
  truth,&mdash;the divine in man. At no time in the history of man has
  civilization been so near a solution of life's supreme problem as at the
  present moment.</p>

  <p>Education is an important function in life's scheme, and while we may
  regret that it is not possible to formulate a system that would be
  perfect and capable of immediate application, we can continue to work
  patiently and hopefully, with assurance that in the near future the
  problem will be satisfactorily solved. When heredity, <!-- Page 29
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span> psychology, and
  eugenics combine to dictate the system, we shall doubtless find, that, in
  the beginning, it will be a system of individualization. In the interest
  of health and of justice, and consequently of efficiency, this would seem
  to be the natural and the logical lead.</p>

  <p>So long as human nature is as it is, we must meet conditions as they
  exist. We know as parents, and some of us know as physicians, that a task
  easily performed by one individual, without any apparent harmful results,
  will tax the capacity of another individual to the very utmost. Any
  educational system which does not recognize this law, is vicious. Yet
  such is the system in vogue to-day in America. We must adapt the burden
  to the endurance of the pupil. The administration of an educational
  machinery must solve this problem from the individual standpoint.</p>

  <p>In the departmental work in our public schools there seems to be no
  system. Each teacher prescribes home work without any knowledge of what
  others of the same grade do, and without any apparent consideration in
  favor of the individual pupil. The result is that the total amount for
  each night is absurdly in excess of the capacity of the ordinary, or for
  that matter the extraordinary, pupil. This engenders nervousness and
  irritability, and is contrary to the ethics of education,&mdash;the
  fundamental law of which should be the preservation of good health. We
  must have regard for the physical and mental health of each pupil, and as
  the capacity of each pupil is different, the system is committing an
  egregious wrong by sacrificing the weaker instead of adapting the burden
  according to the strength and endurance of the bearer.</p>

  <p><b>The High School System Fallacious.</b>&mdash;Even the high schools
  do not seem to be wisely availing themselves of their opportunity from
  the eugenic or economic standpoint. According to the report of the
  Commissioner of Education of the United States the percentage of pupils
  studying some of the more important subjects in the year 1909-1910 is
  stated as follows: <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<pre>
Latin, French and German         83 per cent.
Algebra and Geometry             88  "    "
English Literature               57  "    "
Rhetoric                         57  "    "
History                          55  "    "
Domestic Economy,--including
  sewing, cooking and household
  economies                       4  "    "
</pre>
  <p>If only barely four per cent. of the girls in our high schools are
  studying subjects which directly contribute to their efficiency as
  home-makers, what are the prospects for worthy parenthood in the light of
  the fact that seventy-five per cent. of all women between the ages of
  twenty and twenty-four are married?</p>

  <p>The function of the high school, so far as girls are concerned, is to
  conserve health, to train for domestic efficiency and motherhood, and if
  necessary for economic independence. It must also furnish the stimulus
  for mental culture and direct a proper aspiration for social
  enlightenment. The curriculum should include biology, hygiene,
  psychology, home beautifying, the story-telling side of literature, music
  and a few other studies tending to make woman more like woman than she is
  to-day. When we have this, teaching for mothercraft will be more nearly
  realized.</p>

  <p>From the eugenic standpoint the present system of education is not
  satisfactory. To attain our end it is essential to devise other means of
  education. It must be remembered, however, that no system of education
  alone can ever enable us to achieve our end, no matter how perfect the
  system may be. Education can only draw out what is in the child; it
  cannot draw out what is not there. What the child is, depends upon its
  heredity. The pedagogic ability of the school-master will never make a
  genius.</p>

  <p>A child's mind may be likened to a block puzzle, each block
  representing a part of a picture, which can only be completed when they
  are all arranged in their correct places. Each block is an ancestral
  legacy,&mdash;the child's heritage&mdash;and to find its proper place in
  order to <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>[31]</span> complete the character picture&mdash;to
  solve the riddle of the jumbled blocks,&mdash;is the duty of the
  educator. He can only manipulate what is there, and the test of his
  system will depend upon his ability to solve the puzzle of the ancestral
  blocks. We must divorce ourselves from the idea that a child's mind, at
  the beginning, is an empty space, to be filled in with knowledge
  according to the ability of the teacher; or that it is like a sheet of
  paper, to be written upon. Education, and the educator, is absolutely
  limited to "drawing out" what heredity put there. Education frequently is
  given credit which rightly belongs to nature. A child cannot do certain
  things until nature intends that it should. A baby cannot possibly walk
  until the nervous mechanism which controls the function of walking is
  developed. Many children walk at the first attempt, simply because they
  did not make the first attempt until after nature had perfected the
  mechanism and the innate ability to walk was already there. Suppose we
  tried to teach that baby to walk a month before nature was ready; each
  day we patiently coax it to "step out," we guide it from support to
  support, and we protect it from stumbling. Some day it walks, and we
  congratulate ourselves on the victory, when as a matter of fact, we not
  only had nothing to do with it but were impertinent meddlers, not
  instructors. Nature was the teacher and she was quite capable of
  completing the task without our aid. It is reasonable also to assume that
  any effort to force a natural function is quite likely to do much harm.
  We have found this to be so in various departments of education when the
  system was wrongly conceived. In physical culture this principle has been
  demonstrated over and over again.</p>

  <p>If our ancestral legacy is a good one, our picture blocks will be
  numerous and it will be possible for the proper system of education,
  aided by a suitable environment, to arrange them into many designs. If,
  on the other hand, our heredity did not endow us abundantly the number of
  our picture blocks may be limited to three or four, and they will be
  easily arranged so as to form a simple picture. The one represents a
  child whom heredity has richly endowed, the other one whom it has <!--
  Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span>
  meagerly supplied with innate possibilities. Heredity therefore dictates
  the function of education; and the school-master can only fashion the
  picture put there. If the ancestral blocks are not there with which to
  make an elaborate picture he must content himself with what is
  there,&mdash;he or his art cannot create others. When he congratulates
  himself on achieving a wonderful result in graduating a particularly
  brilliant student, he is taking to himself unmerited honors. If his
  individual ability is responsible in one instance, why not apply the same
  system to all pupils? If this system is responsible for the brilliancy of
  one pupil, why does not the same system make all brilliant? The reader
  knows the answer,&mdash;because heredity did not endow them equally. Men
  are not born equal, despite the Declaration of Independence.</p>

  <p>The school-master is not responsible for the apt and the inapt pupil.
  He is responsible for his system which dictates how he will differentiate
  between the apt and the inapt pupil, in order to achieve the best results
  without injustice to either.</p>

  <p>The inefficient teacher is a dangerous equation in the school system.
  I mean by inefficiency, the quality of being temperamentally unsuited to
  the profession. There are a large number of anemic, hysterical young
  women teaching in the public schools of our cities who should not be
  there. They should not be there in justice to themselves, nor should they
  be there in justice to their pupils. A strict, yearly medical examination
  should be made of the teachers to decide their physical and psychical
  fitness to fill their positions adequately. One teacher, physically or
  psychically inefficient, can do an inconceivable amount of harm in one
  school term. We cannot afford to experiment along this line. It means too
  much, and even at the price of one unhappy child it is too much to pay.
  The teacher who feels that she is not suited to the work; who has
  constantly to hold herself and her temper under control; whose nerves are
  such that she cannot do justice to herself, whose sense of justice is
  capable of perversion on purely sentimental grounds; or who has
  lost&mdash;or never possessed&mdash;the gift of maintaining discipline,
  should promptly find another <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>[33]</span> position. She is earning her salary under
  false pretenses, and that alone condemns her. I believe, that a large
  percentage of the inefficiency of the New York Schools is due, not to the
  academic or scholastic inability of the average teacher, but to the
  average female teacher's physical, and especially her psychical unfitness
  to teach. We must concede, however, that in many instances the teacher's
  unfitness is a direct product of the pernicious system itself.</p>

    <h4>Evidence of a Feeble Mind</h4>

    <p>A dirty shack in a mud hole in the country is merely another
    reflection of the same condition that causes the slums of the city. In
    our glowing spirit of humanity we cry out to raise up "the submerged
    tenth." Rather, should we not stamp them out of existence&mdash;treat
    them as a menace, and not as a thing of pity?</p>

    <p>Men, in general, rise; their minds are subjectively or objectively
    educated to their mental limit. They cannot go beyond it. "The
    submerged tenth" exists because its mental limit is low&mdash;often
    close to the upper margins of feeble-mindedness&mdash;and because it is
    mentally incapable of rising to anything else.</p>

    <h4>Evidence of a Vigorous Mind</h4>

    <p>The family that is vigorous, healthy in mind and body, "up and
    coming," reflects itself in a hundred different ways. Small matter
    whether or not it is "an old family," has wealth, social position, a
    college education. A daughter's or a son's happiness, the real,
    deep-down-inside happiness that is worth while, may be more certainly
    insured by marrying with an eye to mentality and stock than by a
    marriage into a so-called "first family."</p>

    <p>Eugenics hath its reward.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Under an ideal system of education the child would be left absolutely
  free until the age of seven. We do not believe that the physical
  apparatus of the mind is prepared for educational interference before
  that age, and we know that the growth of the brain, physiologically and
  anatomically, is not complete until after the seventh year.</p>

  <p>The greater portion of a child's education necessarily depends upon
  its environment. Heredity and environment, therefore, are the two factors
  which determine the characters of any living thing. Heredity gives to the
  child its potential greatness,&mdash;its promise of greatness. Whether
  these potential qualities ever become real depends upon environment. A
  child may have the hereditary (innate) ability to become a Shakespeare,
  but if his environment is not suitable to the development of this
  potential greatness, he will never realize his hereditary promise. In
  other words, the innate qualities which he has, and which will make of
  him a Shakespeare are never "drawn out" or educated. Hence he can never
  become great until environment furnishes the means to him.</p>

  <p>Environment, including education, does not add to the potential
  qualities of inheritance. Education can only educate what heredity gives;
  it can give or add nothing itself; it simply educates what is there
  already. There is plenty of material, but it is not the right material.
  What educators want is the right kind of material&mdash;the material
  which the eugenists will eventually supply. Or as Mr. Havelock Ellis has
  expressed it:</p>

  <p>"Education has been put at the beginning, when it ought to have been
  put at the end. It matters <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span> comparatively little what sort of education
  we give children; the primary matter is what sort of children we have to
  educate. That is the most fundamental of questions. It lies deeper even
  than the great question of Socialism versus Individualism, and indeed
  touches a foundation that is common to both. The best organized social
  system is only a house of cards if it cannot be constructed with sound
  individuals; and no individualism worth the name is possible unless a
  sound social organization permits the breeding of individuals who count.
  On this plane Socialism and Individualism move in the same circle."</p>

  <p>Education, then, as an exclusive factor, cannot achieve our ideal of
  race-culture. In order that education may achieve a large measure of
  success, it must have the proper material, and the right material can
  only come as a result of the working out of the eugenic principle.
  Then&mdash;in the aftertime&mdash;our educational efforts will not be
  wasted and misdirected, as they are almost wholly to-day.</p>

  <p>If we could transmit our acquired characteristics, education would
  have a relatively smaller, and a much more fixed function in the "general
  scheme," but we cannot. We can only transmit what was inherent in us when
  created. This simply means that, at the moment of conception, the child
  is created,&mdash;it is a completed whole,&mdash;what it is to be is
  fixed at that moment, its inherent capacities are formed. Nothing can
  affect it, in this sense, after that moment. No act of either parent can
  have any influence on it. Whatever ability the father or mother possessed
  of an innate character is transmitted to the child at the instant of
  conception and that innate legacy constitutes the working instrument of
  the child for all time. It cannot be added to by education, or by
  environment, but both of these may have a large influence in deciding
  whether it will be developed to its highest possible limit of
  attainment.</p>

  <p>Education, mental, moral and physical, is limited by this inability to
  transmit acquired character to the persons educated. Each generation
  must, therefore, begin, not where their parents left off, but at the
  point where <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span> they began. The same difficulties and the
  same problems must be met at the beginning of each generation.</p>

  <p><b>The True Province of Education.</b>&mdash;Education may justly be
  the instrument, however, which will educate public opinion to a true
  appreciation of the function of race culture. In this way the cause of
  the eugenist will greatly prosper, and the race will profit through the
  effort which will further the conservation of the best and most fit
  specimens for parenthood. So also may education, through the molding of
  public opinion, create sound opinion,&mdash;when each individual will be
  a center of eugenic enthusiasm. Especially does this responsibility fall
  upon parents and those who are in charge of childhood. The young must be
  taught the supreme sanctity of parenthood. They must be instructed in
  eugenic principles in a way that will impart to them the definite
  knowledge that it is the highest and holiest science. The eugenic
  education of children is the real beginning at the beginning, the
  indispensable necessity, if race culture is to assume its transcendent
  role in modern civilization. It is urgently necessary for both sexes but
  more especially for girls. "Urgently necessary," because, though Herbert
  Spencer wrote the following criticism nearly fifty years ago, the
  conditions are much the same to-day:&mdash;</p>

  <p>... "But though some care is taken to fit youth of both sexes for
  society and citizenship, no care whatever is taken to fit them for the
  position of parents. While it is seen that, for the purpose of gaining a
  livelihood, an elaborate preparation is needed, it appears to be thought
  that for the bringing up of children, no preparation whatever is needed.
  While many years are spent by a boy in gaining knowledge of which the
  chief value is that it constitutes 'the education of a gentleman'; and
  while many years are spent by a girl in those decorative acquirements
  which fit her for evening parties; not an hour is spent by either in
  preparation for that gravest of all responsibilities&mdash;the management
  of a family. Is it that this responsibility is but a remote contingency?
  On the contrary, it is sure to develop on nine out of ten. Is it that the
  discharge of it is easy? Certainly not. Of all functions which the adult
  has to fulfill, this is the <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>[36]</span> most difficult. Is it that each may be
  trusted by self-instruction to fit himself, or herself, for the office of
  parent? No; not only is the need for such self-instruction unrecognized,
  but the complexity of the subject renders it the one of all others in
  which self-instruction is least likely to succeed."</p>

  <p>It must be our highest educational aim to cultivate or create the
  eugenic sense. In this way, and in this way only, may we feel satisfied
  that the foundation, upon which shall be erected the generations that are
  yet to come, will be of an enduring character.</p>

  Magistrate's Report&mdash;Report of the Children's Society&mdash;The
  Segregation and Treatment of the Feeble-Minded&mdash;What the Care of the
  Insane Costs&mdash;The Alcoholic&mdash;Drunkenness.</b></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In order to achieve success in eugenics we must strive to encourage
  the parenthood of the worthy or fit, and to discourage the parenthood of
  the unworthy or unfit. The unfit are those, as previously explained, who,
  because of mental or physical disability, are unable to create fit or
  healthy children.</p>

  <p><b>The Deaf and Dumb.</b>&mdash;The condition known as deaf-mutism is
  due to innate defect in about half of all cases. Deaf children have one
  or two deaf parents or grandparents. There may be two or three such
  children in a family. That the deaf should not marry is generally
  conceded by those who work amongst them. It should be our aim to
  discourage the intimate association of the adolescent deaf and dumb in
  institutions. It has been found that such intimate association frequently
  results in marriage. They should be educated and instructed in the
  knowledge that they cannot marry. When they understand the eugenic
  principle upon which this social law is constructed they will be amenable
  to reason. No process of suasion will be necessary, however, if their
  intimate association is prevented.</p>

  <p><b>The Feeble-Minded.</b>&mdash;This includes the criminal, the
  imbecile, the insane, and the epileptic. The feeble-minded, technically
  speaking, belong to the degenerate <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[38]</span> class. They enter life
  mentally deficient, not necessarily diseased. They should, therefore, be
  regarded as fit subjects for educational modification rather than for
  penal correction or punishment. It is conservatively estimated that there
  are five million feeble-minded people in the United States to-day and not
  one-eighth of them are receiving adequate treatment or education. Recent
  statistics, from various countries, show that the percentage of deficient
  or feeble-minded children is decidedly on the increase. According to a
  bulletin issued by the United States Bureau of Education (August, 1912)
  there are 15,000,000 school children suffering from physical defects
  which need immediate attention and which are prejudicial to health. It
  would seem as though the time had passed for anything other than radical
  measures in the interest of the race.</p>

  <p>Apart from the eugenic fact that these feeble-minded children are not
  fit subjects for parenthood, they are a constantly contaminating
  influence on society morally, and are a detriment and a hindrance to
  social and economic advancement. One illustration of this contaminating
  process, which is of serious eugenic import, is the presence of these
  deficient children in our public schools. By reason of their lack of
  attention and concentration, their mental or psychic insufficiency, their
  moral delinquency, and uncontrollable instincts and impulses, they are a
  menace to the well-being and to the progress of the normal or fit pupils;
  they retard and undermine the discipline of the schoolroom, and they
  affect the efficiency of the teachers. They are allowed to stay in school
  because of the indifference of the authorities, or because of the
  influence and social standing, or political "pull" of the parents,
  despite the recognition of the injustice done. Many of the parents of
  these children seek medical advice but, because of absurdly inadequate
  civic or state provision for such cases, the physician is practically
  helpless. Most of these irresponsible children are allowed to wander
  through the years unrestrained and unprotected. They easily become the
  victims of vice and crime, and eventually they become degenerates and end
  their lives in insane institutions. Because of the stigma <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span> of degeneration
  these feeble-minded individuals fall into the hands of the law and are
  thereby robbed of the medical assistance which society should afford them
  in the early years when improvement is yet possible.</p>

  <p>The following report which recently appeared in one of the daily
  papers is interesting and suggestive in this connection. One of the New
  York City Magistrates, in his annual report, said: "There is growing up
  in this city a menacing army of boys and young men who are the most
  troublesome element we have to deal with.... From the ranks of these
  rowdies that are organized in bands, or bound up with chums or pals, come
  most of the crop of burglars, truck thieves, holdup men, gun-bearers,
  so-called 'bad men' and other criminals and dangerous characters. Without
  reverence for anything, subject to no parental control, cynical,
  viciously wise beyond their years, utterly regardless of the rights of
  others, firmly determined not to work for a living, terrorizing the
  occupants of public vehicles and disturbing the peace of the
  neighborhoods, they have no regard for common decency."</p>

  <p>But it is to the records of the Children's Society that one must go
  for reliable statistics of the potential criminal, as there the only
  systematic study of their conditions is made and recorded by one of the
  greatest neurologists in the country, Dr. Max Schlapp, of New York. As a
  specialist in nervous diseases he has been connected with the Children's
  Society and the Children's Court, where he has had wide opportunities for
  observing the relation between delinquence and mental defectiveness. In
  cases of viciousness or feeble-mindedness exhaustive studies have been
  made by Dr. Schlapp. And the extent to which society is daily at the
  mercy of uncontrolled potential criminality is alarming.</p>

  <p>"Feeble-minded children and feeble-minded men," says Dr. Schlapp, "are
  roaming about the streets of New York to-day as free agents. Parents are
  not compelled by law to put a feeble-minded child in custody. Yet that
  feeble-minded child unsuspected as such, amiable and care-free as he
  usually is, is potentially a criminal, and at any moment may commit a
  crime. That child is permitted <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>[40]</span> to grow up without restraint, except such
  as the parents exercise, and this has no effect whatever in these cases.
  The child is allowed to marry and bring forth children of his own kind,
  more feeble-minded and more dangerous. There is no system designed to
  pick out from the community persons so afflicted, and no law whatever to
  prevent their untrammelled movements.</p>

  <p>"The city street is a recruiting ground for the <ins
  class="correction" title="'ganster' in original">gangster</ins> because
  it is full of defective children, mental and moral, who are potential
  criminals. This question has never been seriously considered. When
  brought under corrective restraint it has hitherto long been the custom
  to herd all the cases together while serving time. But in 1894 the German
  Government woke up to the fact that 3 to 7 per cent. of city children and
  those of isolated rural communities contain the 'moron,' or
  intellectually defective type, together with the moral imbecile."</p>

  <p>Investigation showed recently that in a reformatory near Berlin 63 per
  cent. of the inmates were abnormal, while over 50 per cent. were
  seriously defective or menaces to society. This has since been shown to
  exist in all the leading nations&mdash;England, France, Italy, where, by
  the way, the Camorrist type is the equivalent for our New York gangster.
  In the Elmira Reformatory 38 per cent. are, as a rule, feeble-minded and
  consist of types that repeat their offense against society or commit some
  other crime.</p>

  <p>There is only one way to prevent these types from becoming a menace.
  Restrain them while they are still developing; keep them from becoming
  free agents in the community they menace. Types continually come up in
  the Children's Society and the Children's Court. They are carefully
  studied. From the actions of the child, from his parents and family
  history, from the frequency with which he repeats some offense
  particularly pleasing to him, and by virtue of psychological tests and
  careful medical examinations the examiners are able to pick out children
  who should receive scientific care and treatment.</p>

  <p>"The characteristics of the feeble-minded are usually deceiving. One
  expects to find them with low brows and furtive looks and more or less
  vicious in appearance <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>[41]</span> after they develop criminal tendencies. One
  would expect them to show stupidity at a glance. On the contrary, they
  are sometimes bright on the surface, amiable, good-tempered under trying
  conditions, and almost likeable for their external social side. This is
  particularly true of the high grade defectives. The lower order may be
  taciturn, gloomy and retiring, and these traits may be noticed almost
  from infancy. But as they grow up their social nature may be developed,
  and they too may give the appearance of amiableness. One notable thing
  about them is their pose of frank innocence. In this they are engaging,
  and almost convincing.</p>

  <p>"The street type that makes a gangster is practically the same if
  cruder in development. These children usually exhibit absolutely no sign
  of affection for their parents, no sympathy, and are notably cruel toward
  animals. One boy we had in the Children's Society persistently killed all
  the dogs and cats his family kept. Finally, when they ceased keeping the
  animals he got at the canary cage and killed the bird by pulling the
  feathers out singly. He had no compunction about lying, and looked you
  right in the eye when he lied. Otherwise he was charming and
  natural."</p>

  <p>While moral insanity is hereditary, yet it can be produced in one
  generation. An alcoholic man with clean antecedents may leave tainted
  descendants. The only way to combat these conditions in the city is to
  have strict registration of all feeble-minded and insane. The state
  should discover them, examine them through public officials, and
  segregate them. Not only physicians, but school teachers and officials in
  public institutions should detect them. There should be in each state an
  institution for feeble-minded delinquents.</p>

  <p>The history of the average "gangster" shows a taint of alcoholism.
  This is further aggravated by living under immoral surroundings, where
  petty crimes like stealing and lying are considered "smart." This is the
  starting point of the New York "gangster." He is handicapped, and under
  ancestral disabilities and the disadvantages of environment that is
  pernicious, he cannot get very far. A boy usually qualifies with a gang
  on his <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>[42]</span> own personality and tastes. He will often
  wander from one gang to another until he has found his particular
  atmosphere. The best will never find any one gang congenial enough to
  hold him, and he finally emerges a decent citizen. It is all a process of
  finding himself. The aim of the police should be to discount as much as
  possible any swaggering and false hero worship.</p>

  <p>The time has come when this great nation should take national
  cognizance of this problem. There should be a national institution on
  some isolated island. Civilization is coming to recognize such a
  necessity. With a close eye on the tide of immigration and a careful
  segregation of these defective types, we should soon rid ourselves of
  what is now growing to be a serious menace to the home and the
  nation.</p>

  <p><b>The Segregation and Treatment of the Feeble-Minded.</b>&mdash;Dr.
  John Punton, of Kansas City, Mo., in an able and exhaustive article on
  "The Segregation and Treatment of the Feeble-Minded," writes as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"Your attention is directed to a recent report issued by Wentworth E.
  Griffin, Chief of Police of Kansas City, Mo., in which he claims that
  recently within six months' time no less than 2,480 juveniles were
  arrested charged with crimes ranging from vagrancy to murder and that the
  majority of these boys and girls were not normal children, but
  degenerates who required medical rather than penal treatment. 'Boys and
  girls,' says he, 'should not receive correction in the city jails, the
  work house or reformatories. These should be the last resort. To correct
  a boy you must have an idea of his mental processes. It is natural that
  the parents understand something of the child and use that knowledge to
  make a good boy out of him. Certainly it cannot be done in the
  reformatories, for although the authorities there are competent, they are
  hardly medical psychologists. In my opinion, if any progress is to be
  made it is the parent and the doctor that must do the work, not the
  police and the courts.'</p>

  <p>"That our Chief of Police deserves credit for not only publishing this
  report, but also for the advanced position he takes in recognizing the
  appropriate care and treatment <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>[43]</span> of the juvenile offender, is certain, for
  he understands the fact that the parents are often the chief culprits in
  the child's delinquency and that medical rather than penal treatment is
  more often indicated than is at present allowed or practiced.</p>

  <p>"When we come to inquire into the cause of feeble-mindedness,
  alcoholic heredity, syphilitic heredity, and consanguineous marriages are
  found to be the chief etiological factors. Bourneville claims that 48 per
  cent. of the idiots and imbeciles are the offspring of alcoholic
  parents.... Acute and chronic diseases in the parents, fright, shock,
  injuries, parental neglect, faulty education, poverty, malnutrition,
  social dissipation and lack of proper control are all well-known factors
  in the production of feeble-mindedness.</p>

  <p>"Segregation of the feeble-minded is advocated by medical authority
  the world over, and when this is done they can be made under appropriate
  medico-pedagogic treatment to become largely self-supporting.</p>

  <p>"As an economical as well as a humane measure, the various States can
  well afford to make such provision, more especially for the large body of
  feeble-minded who are now without any medical care whatever. Moreover,
  where it is possible, laws prohibiting the marriage of such as well as
  all other defectives should be passed and enforced."</p>

  <p><b>What the Care of the Insane Costs.</b>&mdash;The total cost of the
  care of the insane, in this country, has been estimated to be
  $165,000,000 a year. In estimating the cost of the insane we must take
  into account the value or worth of each adult to the State. This value
  has been computed to be $700 a year. If, upon this basis, we count the
  adult membership of the insane class between the ages of eighteen and
  forty-five, we find that their worth is roughly about $132,000,000.</p>

  <p>The cost of maintenance in the various insane institutions is about
  thirty-three millions of dollars a year. It would be quite possible to
  justly increase this total by estimating the worth of the help whose
  whole time is devoted to the care of the insane. If these individuals
  worked at some other trade or profession, their time <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[44]</span> would. be of
  value to the state in general&mdash;not to a class who should be
  non-existent. The cost to the state of the potential criminal is not
  included in this estimate.</p>

  <p>From the above figures it may be observed that it costs more to simply
  maintain the insane each year than it costs to work the Panama Canal; or
  to pay for the total cost of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial
  departments of our government. The total cost is more than the entire
  value of the wheat, corn, tobacco, and dairy and beef products exported
  each year from this country.</p>

  <p><b>Alcoholic Drunkenness.</b>&mdash;Alcoholism is a sign and a symptom
  of degeneracy and is a distinct indication of unfitness for parenthood.
  The only cure for alcoholism is to prohibit parenthood. It has been
  proved that alcohol taken into the stomach can be demonstrated in the
  testicle or ovary within a few minutes, and, like any other poison, may
  injure the sperm or the germ element therein contained. As a result of
  this intoxication of the primary elements, children may be conceived and
  born who become idiots, epileptics or feeble-minded. It is asserted that
  48 per cent. of all the idiots and imbeciles are the offspring of
  alcoholic parents.</p>

  <p>Recent experiments show that parental alcoholism alone can determine
  degeneration. Mr. Galton quoted the case of a man who, "after begetting
  several normal children became a drunkard and had imbecile offspring";
  and another case has been recorded of a healthy woman who, when married
  to a drunkard, had five sickly children, dying in infancy, but in a later
  union with a healthy man bore normal and vigorous children.</p>

  <p>Dr. Sullivan found on inquiry that:</p>

  <p>.... "Of 600 children born of 120 drunken mothers 335 died in infancy
  or were still-born, and that several of the survivors were mentally
  defective, and as many as 4.1 per cent. were epileptic. Many of these
  women had female relatives, sisters or daughters, of sober habits and
  married to sober husbands. On comparing the death rate amongst the
  children of the sober mothers with that amongst the children of the
  drunken women of the same stock, the former was found to be 23.9 per
  cent., the latter 55.2 per cent., or nearly two and <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[45]</span> a half times as much. It
  was further observed that in the drunken families there was a progressive
  rise in the death rate from the earlier to the later born children."</p>

  <p>Dr. Sullivan cites as a typical alcoholic family one in which the
  first three children were healthy, the fourth was of defective
  intelligence, the fifth was an epileptic idiot, the sixth was dead born,
  and finally the productive career ended with an abortion.</p>

  <p>The nervous systems of many children of alcoholic parents are wrecked
  for life; many die in convulsions as infants. Many, however, who do not
  die, live as epileptics. This action of alcohol on the health and
  vitality of the race is the most serious of the evils that intemperance
  brings on the community. The tendency of all children of alcoholics is
  toward nervous disorders of a grave type.</p>

  <p>Statistics show a very high rate of still-births and abortions among
  the children of drunken mothers, show that drunken women must not be
  permitted to become mothers.</p>

  <p>Dr. Branthwaite in a lecture stated: "In my judgment, habitual
  drunkenness, so far as women are concerned, has materially increased,
  during the last twenty-five years, which I have spent entirely amongst
  drunkards and drunkenness. These people are not in the least affected by
  orthodox temperance efforts; they continue to propagate drunkenness, and
  thereby nullify the good results of temperance energy. Their children,
  born of defective parents, and educated by their surroundings grow up
  without a chance of decent life, and constitute the reserve from which
  the strength of our present army of habitual drunkards is maintained.
  Truly we have neglected in the past, and are still neglecting, the main
  source of drunkard supply&mdash;the drunkard himself; crippled that and
  we should soon see some good results from our work."</p>

  <p>Dr. Fleck, another authority, says: "It is my strong conviction that a
  large percentage of our mentally defective children, including idiots,
  imbeciles and epileptics, are the descendants of drunkards."</p>

  <p>Therefore the chronic inebriate must not become a parent.</p>

  <p>"The real undermining of health is not seen. It is done in an
  insidious way. It has to be carefully ferreted out."</p>

  <p class="author"><font class="sc">Dr. Harvey W. Wiley</font>.</p>

<h3>WHAT EVERY MOTHER SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT EUGENICS</h3>

  <p>In the preceding pages we have written about eugenics as a science; it
  is our intention now to point out briefly in just what way eugenics
  directly concerns the mothers of to-day. In the first place let us try to
  appreciate what it will mean to the race if "the fit only are born."
  "Fit" children, it will be recalled, means children born healthy of
  healthy, selected parents, parents with a good ancestral history,
  conveying to their offspring a reasonably adequate legacy. If the "fit
  only are born" we start with a healthy stock. What a significant and
  tremendous advantage this is. At once we rid the world of the potential
  inefficients&mdash;the feeble-minded, the insane, the criminal, the
  deaf-mute, the drunkard. If we are correct in assuming that the reason
  why all former civilizations have failed and passed away, was because
  they bred a race of people physically and mentally unfit to survive, the
  demand of the eugenist that only "fit children shall be born" will strike
  at the very root of this evil. If we uproot the cause of racial
  degeneration we begin the building of a race that should not degenerate.
  If we establish a race that will not degenerate, it must gain strength
  and virility with each generation.</p>

  <p>This assumption is logically correct, but we must do more than breed
  "fit" children. We must take care of them after they are born. We must
  furnish them with a good environment (see page <a href="#page3">3</a>).
  Heredity without favorable environment counts for very little,&mdash;we
  must never forget that. Heredity and environment are the two important
  determining factors in the life of every <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[48]</span> child born. If eugenics
  furnishes the heredity by ensuring the birth of the "fit" only, it
  depends upon the mothers of the race to provide the environment. Every
  mother must know how to take the best care of herself and of her child.
  This book is devoted to instructing her in the details of this duty.</p>

  <p>We cannot hope, however, to reach this high altruistic plane by simply
  taking the first step in the right direction. We who are alive to-day
  must begin the work, and leave it to posterity to carry forward. We must
  do our part. Every mother must become an enthusiastic eugenist. If she
  begins to teach, and preach, and practise its principles now, she will
  contribute to the heredity of unborn generations. To those of us who are
  alive to-day, environment is the vastly more important consideration, for
  our heredity is fixed and beyond the power of control. The question of
  eugenics for the present generation, therefore, is a question of
  environment.</p>

  <p>All our efforts must be directly in developing what heredity gives our
  children. We are wholly responsible for that. We must feed and clothe
  them properly; we must provide air spaces and playgrounds for exercise;
  we must educate them, and protect them from disease; and we must
  safeguard the birth of future generations by keeping our race stream
  pure. This is no small task, and the only way it will ever be
  satisfactorily accomplished is for each mother to realize her individual
  trust. The average individual does not realize the actual conditions that
  prevail. When recently the question of the public health was investigated
  by competent authorities, and the report furnished to the United States
  Senate, it caused a tremendous sensation. If that is possible in a body
  composed of men who are supposed to be intelligent and wide-awake to
  existing conditions, how much more significant and appalling it should be
  to the average mother whose interest is centered in her own home.</p>

  <p>According to the statistics and statements given in that document the
  annual financial loss from needless deaths and accidents alone amounted
  to $3,000,000,000. <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>[49]</span></p>

  <p>Acute diseases are held responsible for a large part of the loss.
  Chronic diseases are responsible for the greatest part of the waste of
  life, and they are believed to be increasing in their ravages. Minor
  ailments, believed to be nine-tenths preventable, are now costing the
  nation many dollars through incapacitation of persons and through leading
  to serious illness. Industrial accidents, largely preventable, are also
  exacting a heavy toll annually.</p>

  <p>That this great waste of life and health and the national economic
  loss that results can be modified by national action is asserted. Here
  are to be found the reasons advanced for a great national department of
  health. The work of this department would be varied. It would include
  direct work in promoting health on the part of the government, such as
  administering the food and drug act; aiding the healing and educational
  agencies, both city and State; obtaining information concerning the cause
  and prevention of diseases, and disseminating scientifically proved
  information on all health subjects.</p>

  <p>It is maintained that the movement for the conservation of health is
  the most momentous of the conservation movements in this country, and
  that of all the national wastes which are to be condemned, this waste of
  health is the gravest.</p>

  <p>Many startling statements are set forth in the document. Dr. Charles
  Wardell Stiles, of the United States Public Health and Marine Hospital
  Services, declares that "The United States is seven times dirtier than
  Germany and ten times as unclean as Switzerland." He declares that: "Lack
  of interest in preventive measures against diseases is slaughtering the
  human race." He takes the position that the real trouble is not so much
  race suicide as race slaughter, and that it is rather that too many
  children are allowed to die than that not enough children are born.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that tuberculosis, a preventable disease, costs the
  nations $1,000,000,000 annually. Typhoid fever is estimated by Dr. George
  M. Kober, dean of the medical department of Georgetown University, to
  cost over $300,000,000 annually. <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>[50]</span></p>

  <p>In connection with acute diseases this statement is made: "The loss
  from tuberculosis has been reduced to half of what it was thirty years
  ago. Nevertheless, of the 90,000,000 people now living in the United
  States at least 5,000,000 will be lost through this disease because
  adequate effort is not made to prevent it. Besides the economic waste
  through deaths from any disease, the waste through sickness from the same
  disease is also colossal."</p>

  <p>Great as are the reductions in the rates of infant mortality by
  improved milk and water supplies and by educational campaigns, the
  present rate is still enormous.</p>

  <p>"If some witch or wizard could conjure up the unnecessary babies'
  funerals annually occurring in this country it would be found that the
  little hearses would reach from New York to Chicago. If we should add the
  mourning mothers and friends, it would make a cortége extending across
  the continent."</p>

  <p>While the death rates from acute diseases have been greatly reduced,
  the rates from chronic diseases have been steadily increasing. Cancer is
  one of the chronic diseases apparently on the increase.</p>

  <p>That the annual death toll and the 3,000,000 constant sick beds could
  be reduced from one-fourth to one-half by proper measures is asserted. In
  other words, there might be saved every day, as many lives as perished on
  the <i>Titanic</i>, with the consequent enormous economic saving.</p>

  <p>These are surely impressive statements. It would seem as though it
  should be a simple task to pass a Public Health Bill, establishing a
  bureau in Washington, with a representative in the cabinet, whose sole
  duty it would be to preserve the public health. It has proved rather the
  reverse, however. We have been able to inaugurate various species of
  conservation,&mdash;of lands, of forests, of water,&mdash;but the
  conservation of human life is not important enough. Even though states
  and empires depend upon their people for their very existence, our
  statesmen feel that human life is too cheap, too common, to take
  immediate steps in this direction.</p>

  <p>If women&mdash;especially mothers&mdash;would devote <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[51]</span> themselves to
  the eugenic end of legislation, men would soon obey. The application of
  eugenics to the human species, coming, almost in the spirit of an
  inspiration, at the time when women are about to be enfranchised, is
  significant. It may be that destiny has decreed that the one shall be the
  complement of the other; it is certainly beyond contradiction that in
  eugenics the women of the earth have a divine weapon with which to wage a
  righteous and an awaking propaganda of truth.</p>

  <p>A mother should be interested in every phase of the subject. Her
  daughter's success in marriage should intimately concern her. Her health
  and her happiness in that sphere should elicit her deepest maternal
  consideration. She may rightly hope to be proud of her daughter's
  offspring, and to find pleasure in the society of her grandchildren. She
  should, therefore, devote all her efforts to ascertain the truth, with
  reference to the physical and mental equipment of her future son-in-law;
  his ability adequately to support a family; his sobriety, his
  disposition, associates, etc., should all be carefully considered and
  pondered over. This is not going far enough, however; we must know
  positively that he is not diseased,&mdash;that he is not a victim of
  gonorrhoea or syphilis.</p>

  <p>When parents weigh in the balance the possibility of a wrecked life,
  of destroying the right to have children, or of bringing them into the
  world blind or diseased; of permanently destroying the hope of happiness,
  peace, and success, no combination of advantages in a son-in-law is
  deserving of the slightest consideration. We are treating of the sacred
  things of life&mdash;of life itself. If parents combine to crucify and
  betray their daughters&mdash;to sell them body and soul into bondage for
  social or other advantages; if they preserve silence when they should
  speak and thereby take all the sunshine, for all eternity, out of one
  existence; then, if on their death-beds these daughters should accuse
  them, the guilty knowledge that they were responsible will be the sting
  that will blast their hope of peace and forgiveness here and in the
  worlds to come.</p>

  <p>When mothers realize that, every day, in every large hospital in every
  city in the civilized world some woman <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span> (a daughter of some
  mother) is being unsexed because of these unjustly obtained diseases,
  surely their voices shall speak in no uncertain way.</p>

  <p>Another eugenic suggestion that should deeply concern every good
  mother is, that the mother's milk is the private property of the babe,
  and whoever deprives the babe of this, the sole right it possesses, is
  not only a thief but a scoundrel. A curious and significant fact was
  discovered by investigators when studying the question of infant
  mortality a few years ago. It was found from a mass of statistics that
  there were two recent instances when the death rate of infants decreased
  suddenly and quite decidedly. The first instance was when the Civil War
  in this country caused a cotton famine in England. As a result of the
  famine the factories of Lancashire were all closed and the employees
  being then without work remained at home. As a large percentage of the
  workers were married women with children they had the time and the
  opportunity to nurse their children regularly. Despite the fact that
  these women were starved and badly clad and deprived of the comforts of
  home, the death rate of the infants dropped steadily to an unprecedently
  low mark.</p>

  <p>A number of years later, when the German army surrounded Paris during
  the Franco-Prussian War the besieged inhabitants of the capital suffered
  from hunger and disease. The death rate of the adult population increased
  enormously while the death rate of the infants dropped markedly.</p>

  <p>The explanation of this curious phenomenon was simply that while times
  were normal the women labored outside of their homes and as a consequence
  the babies were not fed regularly and when fed were not fed mothers'
  milk. It demonstrated a truth that we are apt to lose sight of, that
  mothers' milk, even the milk from badly-nourished, poverty-stricken
  mothers is infinitely better than an abundant supply of artificial food
  combined with neglect. In view of the fact that there is a distinct
  tendency to evade this maternal duty these facts should be suggestive and
  important. It is the duty of the mother with any eugenic sense to preach
  and to practise <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>[53]</span> this gospel. Paris learned the lesson of
  the siege because though she has the smallest birth-rate to-day, she
  nevertheless has the smallest infant death-rate of any large city in
  Europe.</p>

  <p>The writer believes that in eugenics the women of the race have the
  instrument wherewith to save the world. He is assured that it is the
  supreme potential agency for the betterment of the race, and that mankind
  will never be inspired with a holier cause. He believes that through all
  the ages the human race has been growing better, coming nearer the truth,
  and that as a result of this patient progress, there has been evolved the
  eugenic idea that is to solve the problems of the human family. If the
  "fit only are born" think of the possibilities of education and of
  environment. Each child is born with a great potential promise, and
  endowed with a reasonably good heredity, the whole effort of that child
  will be toward a higher moral attainment. If the effort of the
  individuals of the race is to achieve a high moral success, the quality
  of the civilization of future generations will be far superior to the
  type with which we are familiar.</p>

  <p>Eugenics gives to women the supreme civilizing instrument of the
  future. It places the burden of the morality of the home and of the race
  on their shoulders. If we deny the writing on the wall it does not render
  the warning negative. The signs of the times are epochal. The great
  political parties are realizing, for the first time in history, that new
  and important issues concerning the family, the home, and the children,
  in other words the nation's manhood and womanhood, must be considered and
  included in their platforms. They know that the time has gone when
  statesmen will exclusively decide what shall be done with the sons and
  daughters which women bring into the world. They know that the mothers of
  the race must have a voice in deciding for peace or war since they create
  every soldier that will lie dead when war is over. Women will help decide
  the question of taxation by government and by trusts, because they know
  that it comes out of their incomes and they need it all for their
  children. Women know that their cause is the cause of freedom, and
  freedom is the <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span> cause of the eugenist. They know that the
  function of government should be justice and no code of justice can have
  higher ethics than the ethics of eugenism.</p>

  <p><b>Mothers' Eugenic Clubs.</b>&mdash;There should be established in
  every community a mothers' eugenic club. The object of the club should be
  to further the eugenic idea. Papers should be prepared, read, and
  discussed on subjects having a eugenic interest.</p>

  <p>One of the main aims of these clubs should be to interest the local
  Congressman and the member of the State Legislature in eugenics. In all
  probability they will know nothing specific about
  race-culture&mdash;unless they are exceptional men&mdash;in which case it
  will be the duty of the members of the club to educate them. The object
  of such education of course would be to ensure that they will act
  intelligently when any legislative proposal is made having a eugenic
  interest. Find out what they know about the public health as contained in
  the report on page <a href="#page48">48</a>, and if they will vote in
  favor of a Public Health Bureau. You should know how your representatives
  stand on the Pure Food and Drugs Act; if they really appreciate the
  significance of the measure; if they would be in favor of pensioning
  mothers and widows who have children depending upon them; what their
  views are regarding compulsory marriage licenses; the reporting of
  venereal diseases to the local health authorities; if they would favor
  the segregation of the feeble-minded and their maintenance and treatment
  by the state; if they endorse the eugenic principle that "the fit only
  shall be born," and if they really understand just what that means.</p>

  <p>If the mothers in every community would take this step, they could
  control the legislation affecting such subjects in a comparatively short
  time. If the various States concede to women the right to vote&mdash;as
  they will sooner or later&mdash;such mothers' clubs would have a large
  and intelligent share in educating the women's votes on questions which
  directly concern their own immediate and remote welfare.</p>

  <p>The question of education would concern these clubs and much could be
  done by mothers to direct the authorities as to just what is needed to
  educate for <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[55]</span> parenthood, along the lines suggested
  elsewhere in this book.</p>

  <p>A mothers' eugenic club would rightly become an instrument for good in
  all local sociological interests. It could maintain a trained nurse to
  care for the sick and helpless, to teach the people how to live, and how
  to care for their homes and their children. The members themselves could
  visit the poor, the needy, and the sick.</p>

  <p>There are so many people in the world who are near the brink of
  failure,&mdash;so many who need a little hope infused into their
  lives,&mdash;and so many who are really deserving of help and sympathy
  and inspiration. The women who do this work for the work's sake are amply
  repaid by the good they find to do. The doing of such work is a
  consecration and an education. Life means more, and the whole temperament
  reflects a truer sympathy and a stronger purpose.</p>

  <p>There are many mothers, for example, who are willing to do what is
  essential in the interest of their children, but they do not know what
  should be done. These people cannot afford a physician or a nurse to
  teach them, nor do they even know that their methods are wrong or that
  they need any instruction. We must carry the information and the
  explanation to them. We must show them the need for a change of methods.
  This is the work for those charitably disposed women who desire some
  worthy purpose in life, who really wish to do some genuine good. All the
  equipment they need is good common sense. They will explain why it is
  essential to pasteurize the milk before feeding it to the baby because
  most of the milk used by the poor is unfit for use as a baby food. They
  will show how to keep the nipples and the bottles clean, and they will
  give them lessons on how to prepare the food to the best advantage. They
  will instruct them how to dress the baby in hot weather, and they will
  explain why it is necessary to provide the baby with all the fresh air
  possible. They will gain the confidence of these mothers and they will
  tell them all they know, in tactful and diplomatic and common-sense
  language so that they may appreciate the eugenic reasons for everything
  they do regarding the care and well-being of the baby. In every city in
  the country this work is needed and is <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span> waiting for the
  missionaries who will volunteer. To teach mothers the need for boiled
  water as a necessary drink for baby and older children is alone a worthy
  avocation. To impress upon one of these willing but ignorant mothers the
  absolute necessity for washing her hands before preparing baby's food,
  that she must keep a covered vessel in which the soiled napkins are
  placed until washed, that she should frequently sponge her baby in hot
  weather,&mdash;and explain thoroughly why these are important
  details,&mdash;is a work of true religious charity. They should be taught
  to rid their houses of flies, and especially to keep them from the baby
  and from its food, bottles, and nipples. They should be instructed to
  discontinue milk at the first sign of intestinal trouble, to give a
  suitable dose of castor oil, and to put the child on barley water as a
  food until the danger is passed. They should be taught to know the
  serious significance of a green watery stool, that it is the one danger
  signal in the summer time that no mother can ignore without wilfully
  risking the life of her baby. They should be shown how to prepare special
  articles of diet when they are needed. If every mother were educated to
  the extent as indicated in the above outline the appalling infant
  mortality would fall into insignificance. It is not a difficult task, nor
  would it take a long time to carry out; it is the work for willing women
  who have time and who perhaps spend that time in less desirable but more
  dramatic ways. It is education that is needed, and it is education that
  is willingly received, as all mothers are ready to devote their time in
  the acquirement of knowledge that will help them save their offspring.
  This is the eugenic opportunity and it is an opportunity that should
  devolve upon the women of the race.</p>

  <p>Such a mothers' club would receive the willing financial support of
  the men of the community. It should be placed upon a sound financial
  basis because, to be successful, it would have to bestow much material
  aid. I know of clubs that are self-supporting, however. Each club needs a
  leader to begin it; will the reader be that one in her Community?</p>

  <p>A Mothers' Eugenic Club would of course discuss <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[57]</span> the practical side of
  the eugenic question: the proper feeding and clothing of children;
  hygiene, sanitation, housekeeping and homemaking, and the efficiency and
  health of each member of the home, and all other topics of interest to
  every wife and mother. The writer believes that in the very near future
  we shall have a Mothers' Eugenic Club in every community in the United
  States; that these clubs will be guided by, and be an instrument of, a
  National Eugenic Bureau, composed of women, that will coöperate and
  harmonize the work as a whole, so that the conservation of human life
  will be effected to its maximum extent; that the excessive infant
  mortality will be overcome, because ignorant and incompetent
  mothers&mdash;the greatest cause of infant mortality&mdash;will be
  educated and instructed in the rudiments of eugenics and will
  consequently, to a large extent, cease to be ignorant and incompetent;
  that the desecration of young wives will stop, and stop forever, because
  vice and disease will be branded and exposed; that the feeble-minded, the
  deaf-mute, the imbecile, and the insane, will no longer be allowed to
  propagate their kind, to the permanent detriment of the race.</p>

  <p>When such clubs are established, and when all mothers do their
  individual duty in the interest of the race, we shall begin to see the
  dawn of a promise that will achieve its supreme success in the
  generations that will people the earth in the eugenic aftertime.</p>

  <p>The room in which the confinement is to take place should be selected
  with care. In many cases there will be no choice for the reason that
  there will be only one suitable bedroom available. Where practicable

  <p>4.&mdash;Fairly large size (not a hallroom).</p>

  <p>5.&mdash;A quiet room, free from street noises.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the house is a private one the room should be on the second floor.
  If the home is in an apartment house <!-- Page 62 --><span

  should be as far removed from the living-room as circumstances will
  permit,&mdash;especially if there are other children who will make more
  or less continuous noise.</p>

  <p>All unnecessary furniture, pictures and draperies should be taken out
  of the room a few days before the confinement is due; the room itself,
  and everything left in it, should be thoroughly cleaned and aired. A
  small table for holding instruments, sterilizing basins, etc., should be
  provided and in readiness.</p>

  <p><b>What to Provide For a Confinement.</b>&mdash;The following articles

</blockquote>

  <p>The physician will direct that certain additional articles be provided
  according to his individual taste and <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>[63]</span> custom. These will
  include an antiseptic and ergot; any other requisite found necessary can
  be sent for, or the physician can supply it, as he invariably has in his
  bag whatever may be required in complicated cases or in an emergency. All
  the items enumerated in the above list are absolutely essential, they may

  without providing the essential requisites. Many maternity outfits are

  <p><b>The Position and Arrangement of the Bed.</b>&mdash;The bed should
  be a substantial single bed. If a double one is used, prepare the side
  for the confinement which will permit the physician to use his right
  hand,&mdash;that will be the right side of the patient as she lies in
  bed. One objection to a double bed is its tendency to sag. This tendency
  can be obviated however by placing an ironing board under the spring from
  side to side, or by using shelves from a book case. This expedient will
  support the mattress, thereby rendering the bed firm and free from any
  sagging tendency. The position of the bed in the room should be such that
  the patient will not directly face the window light, nor be in a direct
  draught <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[65]</span> between the window and the door. It should
  be so arranged that the nurse can get easily to either side, consequently
  it must not be pushed against the wall.</p>

  <p><b>How to Prepare the Accouchment Bed.</b>&mdash;Over the mattress
  place the rubber sheet so that its center will be exactly under the hips
  of the patient. Pin with large safety pins each corner of the rubber
  sheet to the mattress; now put the sheet on exactly as you do when making
  an ordinary bed. On top of the sheet, and in the middle of the bed (again
  where the patient's hips will rest), place a draw sheet. A draw sheet is
  a sheet folded once, placed across the bed, and pinned tightly with large
  safety pins to the mattress at each side. The advantage of this sheet is,
  that it can be removed when necessary, leaving the original clean sheet
  on the bed, without disturbing the patient. Be particular not to have the
  top of the draw sheet higher than the middle of the patient's back. Place
  the pad,&mdash;previously prepared for the purpose,&mdash;on the draw
  sheet and level with the top of the draw sheet.</p>

  <p>Most physicians carry with them to all confinements a <i>Kelly
  pad</i>. A Kelly pad is a rubber pad with inflated sides, which is put
  under the patient's hips, and which retains all the discharges incident
  to a <ins class="correction" title="'confiement' in original"
  >confinement</ins> so that when it is removed the bed is clean and fresh.
  The advantage of the Kelly <ins class="correction" title="'paid' in original"
  >pad</ins> is twofold; first, it ensures a clean, compact, systematic
  confinement; second, its use subjects the patient to the least necessary
  movement at a time when movement is distressing, painful, and frequently
  dangerous. If a Kelly pad is not used, it is desirable to place under the
  pad (between the pad and the draw sheet) a piece of oil cloth or rubber
  sheeting, or a number of newspapers will do. This will prevent, to a
  considerable degree, the discharges from soaking through the pad on to
  the draw sheet and sheet and mattress below.</p>

  <p>After the confinement is over and the patient is clean, remove the
  Kelly pad, and the pad below if necessary, or the pad and newspapers if
  these are used,&mdash;place a clean pad under the patient and you are
  ready to place the binder on if a binder is to be used. <!-- Page 66
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span></p>

  <p><b>Should a Binder be Used?</b>&mdash;Medically a binder is not
  necessary, neither is it objectionable from a medical standpoint. It is
  supposed to hold the flaccid, empty womb in place. This it does not do
  and we are of the opinion, that it, in many instances, according to how
  it is put on, compresses the womb out of place. The binder is certainly
  appreciated by most patients because of its snug, comfortable feeling;
  and in cases when the abdominal wall is fat and the muscles soft, it
  holds them together in a way that is impossible by the use of any other
  device. To claim that the binder prevents hemorrhages is absurd. Our
  personal rule is to put one on if the patient wants one, or if she has
  previously had one. To be effective, in any sense, the binder should
  extend from the waist line down to halfway between the hips and knees and
  should be snugly, but not too tightly pinned.</p>

  <p><b>Sanitary Napkins.</b>&mdash;These can be purchased already prepared
  in most drug stores, or they can be made in the following manner: Take an
  ordinary grade of cheese cloth, wash it, and when dry, cut it into half
  yard squares. In the center of each square place a strip, six or eight
  inches long, of absorbent cotton and fold the gauze lengthwise over it so
  as to make a pad. These can be used as napkins, and after they are soiled
  can be burned. It is absolutely wrong to use rags or any old cloths for
  napkins, as the patient can be infected and made seriously sick by this
  procedure.</p>

  <p><b>How to Calculate the Probable Date of the
  Confinement.</b>&mdash;The duration of pregnancy extends for 280 days
  from the end of the last menstruation. Add seven days to the date of the
  last menstruation, and from that date count ahead nine months, or
  backward three months and you may have the probable date of the
  confinement. Should you pass this time you will probably go on for two
  additional weeks. The reason for this is that the most susceptible time
  for conception to occur is either during the week following menstruation
  or a few days before menstruation. If, therefore, you pass the above
  probable date which was calculated from the end of the last menstruation,
  it shows that conception did not take <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span> place during the week
  following that menstruation; and the assumption will be that it took
  place a few days before the next menstruation, which will be about two
  weeks later than the date as calculated above.</p>

  <p>If, for example, a pregnant woman was last sick from January 1st to
  5th we add seven days to the 5th, which is the 12th, to which we add nine
  months, which will give us, as the probable date of confinement, October
  12th. Should she go a few days over the 12th, the probability is that the
  confinement will take place on October 26th.</p>

  <p>The foregoing table affords us a handy means of finding the probable
  date of confinement at a glance.</p>

  <p>Find the date of the last day of the last menstrual period in the
  upper row; the date immediately below it is the probable date of
  confinement.</p>

  <p>For example if the last menstrual period was from Jan. 1st to 5th, we
  find January 5th and below it we note October 12th as the probable date
  of confinement.</p>

  <p><b>When Should a Pregnant Woman First Call Upon Her
  Physician?</b>&mdash;The earliest indication of pregnancy is the
  interruption of menstruation. When menstruation fails to appear at its
  regular time in a young married woman whose past menstrual history is
  good,&mdash;i.e., she has been sick every month regularly and without
  pain since she began menstruating as a girl,&mdash;the assumption would
  naturally be that she was pregnant. Menstruation may however "miss" one
  month for other reasons than pregnancy just at this time, as is explained
  elsewhere, so it is wise to defer a positive assumption on such an
  important matter. When the second menstruation does not appear, and there
  are no specific reasons for its failure to appear, it may be safely
  assumed that pregnancy has taken place. A visit to the family physician
  one week after the second menstruation should have appeared, or at least
  long enough to feel absolutely certain that the sickness is not coming
  around, is not only necessary, but is the essential and correct step to
  take for a number of very good reasons. If a woman for example has not
  had a baby, how does she know she can have one? It is quite possible to
  become pregnant and yet it may be wholly impossible to give birth to a
  child. It is necessary to be constructed normally, or as near what is
  regarded as normal as is possible, in order safely to assume the
  responsibility of carrying a pregnancy to a successful completion. No one
  but a physician, who is skilled and familiar in the knowledge of what
  constitutes the proper size, and shape, and quality, and relations, one
  with another, of <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>[69]</span> your bones, and ligaments, and muscles, can
  tell whether you can safely be permitted to carry a pregnancy to term or
  not. If the anatomical conditions are not just right; if circumstances
  from a medical standpoint are not favorable; if your personal risk is too
  hazardous; if, in other words, medical science should decide that you are
  one of the very few women who cannot have a baby, is it not of very great
  importance that you should know this as soon as possible? Does not that
  fact alone render your early call upon your physician imperative? A
  physician can bring out facts, relating to the personal and family
  history, and habits, of the prospective mother, which will enable him to
  formulate advice which will prove of the highest value from the very
  beginning of pregnancy. Instructions carried into effect at this early
  date, as to personal conduct, exercise, diet, etc., will have a
  distinctly beneficial influence, not only on the patient's health and the
  character of her confinement, but on the physical vitality of the coming
  baby.</p>

  <p><b>Regarding the Choice of a Physician.</b>&mdash;This is a matter
  that should receive the most careful consideration. While it is just to
  admit that every physician is capable of successfully conducting
  maternity cases, there are certain characteristics in the individual
  temperament that would seem to indicate that some physicians are better
  adapted to this special work.</p>

  <p>Trustworthiness is an imperative essential in a physician who assumes
  the responsibility of confinement engagements. He must be clean in his
  personal habits as well as morally. He should possess the virtue of
  patience and be tactful, and above all he should be made to feel that he
  has your implicit confidence. If you will analyze these qualifications
  you will understand just what they imply. The physician who has the
  reputation of having the largest practice is not necessarily the man you
  want, nor does it imply that he is the best fitted to conduct your case
  to your satisfaction. The fact that he is a very busy man may be
  distinctly detrimental to your best interests. If the physician has the
  reputation of being an excellent doctor, but, "You can't always depend on
  him,&mdash;he may be out of town, or he may send his assistant, or <!--
  Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[70]</span>
  substitute," you don't want him; it is too important an event to you to
  take a chance with. Rely rather upon the man who, though his charge may
  be a little higher, is known to be trustworthy; who will take a personal
  interest in you, and is known to be patient and capable.</p>

  <p><b>The Selection of a Nurse.</b>&mdash;A choice must be made between
  having a trained nurse and what is known as a maternity, or monthly,
  nurse. The choice may be dictated by the financial means of the patient.
  A trained nurse is paid from $25 to $30 per week, while a maternity nurse
  usually gets $15 per week.</p>

  <p>A trained nurse is a graduate from a hospital where she has
  successfully completed a course of training. She is to be preferred, if
  she can be afforded, for the reason that she has been trained to obey
  absolutely the orders of a physician, and because she has the requisite
  knowledge to detect emergencies, and the necessary skill and experience
  to enable her to act intelligently of her own initiative in any
  emergency.</p>

  <p>The maternity nurse, on the other hand, has not had an adequate
  training and is absolutely helpless, so far as medical knowledge is
  concerned, in a real emergency. Her experience is limited to what she has
  picked up in the various cases she has had. She, as a rule, has chosen
  this means of obtaining a living as a result of some domestic financial
  affliction. She does not understand the laws of sterilization and has not
  been trained to obey, without question, the instructions of a physician.
  The maternity nurse follows a routine which she is incapable of modifying
  to suit the particular case. She has old-fashioned ideas and notions
  which she carries out as a matter of course, and she overestimates the
  great importance of her experience to the extent of wholly disregarding
  the advice of the physician. She assumes the care of the patient and
  baby, and regards this as her right, and as a result she is frequently
  responsible for much injury to the mother and child. Despite these
  objections we have worked with many of these nurses who were to be
  preferred to trained nurses. It is the individual after all that counts,
  and if a maternity nurse, though technically untrained, is adaptable,
  tactful, and will consent <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[71]</span> to be instructed to the extent of obeying
  without argument, she can become invaluable, and her skill and experience
  will carry her creditably over many trying incidents. The objection of
  the medical profession to an untrained nurse is based, not so much on her
  lack of ability, as upon her propensity to indiscriminate and indiscreet
  talk,&mdash;they have not been trained to know the value of professional
  silence, nor have they had the necessary education which would have
  enabled them to acquire through their experience the knowledge that
  "silence is golden" at all times. A trained nurse possesses the requisite
  knowledge, but may have an objectionable individuality. An untrained
  nurse may have sufficient knowledge, and what she lacks she may make up
  for in being congenial and adaptable. While the trained nurse strictly
  attends exclusively to the mother and the baby, a maternity nurse as a
  rule attends to the household duties in addition. She cooks the meals of
  the entire family, and dresses and cares for the other children if there
  is no one else to do it. The duties of a maternity nurse can be specified
  and agreed upon, and the terms arranged when she is engaged. The duties
  of a trained nurse are fixed by nursing laws and medical rules and cannot
  be changed or modified by private agreement. These laws and rules,
  however, are not sufficiently arbitrary to make it impossible for the
  nurse to be obliging, courteous, and sincere,&mdash;qualifications which
  every patient has a right to expect, and a right to insist upon from
  every graduate nurse.</p>

  <p>The selection of a nurse should receive careful consideration. She
  should be known to be honest, honorable, competent, healthy, and
  personally clean in habits and dress, and she should be tactful,
  obliging, and she should attend to her own affairs strictly. She should
  not be a gossip; she should not shirk her work or pry into family affairs
  that do not concern her; and she should not drag into the conversation
  her own personal or family secrets.</p>

  <p>The nurse has certain rights which the patient should willingly
  recognize. She is entitled to a comfortable bed, sufficient sleep, good
  food, and exercise in the open air <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[72]</span> every day. These are
  essential in order that she maintain her own health, as well as keep at
  the highest point of efficiency.</p>

  <p>When you select your physician consult with him regarding your nurse.
  If you know personally a capable nurse, there is no objection to
  selecting her, and no physician will oppose this procedure if you assume
  the responsibility of her capability.</p>

  <p>There are many advantages, however, in permitting the physician to
  provide a nurse. He assumes the responsibility of the nurse's capability,
  and it is safe to assume he will not recommend one whom he knows to be
  personally objectionable, or professionally incapable. Every physician
  acquires certain individual methods in the conduct of maternity cases,
  which experience has taught him to be successful. A competent knowledge
  of these methods by the nurse greatly facilitates the details and ensures
  a harmonious conduct of the entire case,&mdash;facts which accrue to the
  comfort and the well-being of the patient.</p>

  <p>It is not out of place here to warn a young wife against being advised
  by a neighbor or a busybody, as to whom she should select as physician or
  nurse. You must not depend upon the gossip of the neighborhood. The
  physician or nurse whom you are told by one of these irresponsible
  individuals not to take, may be the one above all others whom you should
  take. When you hear a gossiping woman decry a physician, depend upon it,
  she owes him something,&mdash;most often it is a bill, but it may only be
  a grudge. There is no class of men in any community who are maligned and
  abused so much as are physicians. They seem to be the choice victims of
  the enmity and spite of every malicious feminine tongue. A woman should
  think twice before she utters a criticism regarding the work of a
  physician. She would, if she but knew how quickly she brands and
  advertises herself as irresponsible and lacking in ordinary courtesy and
  good breeding, as she is not qualified to criticise the professional
  capability of a physician, nor is she qualified to estimate the extent of
  the wrong she perpetrates. There is no class of men who do more
  conscientious work, day <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>[73]</span> after day, than do physicians, and there is
  no class of men who are more deserving of the commendation of the entire
  community than the thousands of self-sacrificing, underpaid members of
  the medical profession. Be suspicious therefore when you hear a
  criticism, and be very, very sure before you utter one,&mdash;rather give
  him the benefit of the doubt and you will do no wrong, and it may be at
  some future date you will be thankful you did not criticise.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>CONDUCT OF THE PREGNANT WOMAN</h4>

  <p>The young wife will arrange her daily routine according to the
  physician's instructions, which, by the way, she should faithfully carry
  out. If you are one of the fortunate many who enjoy reasonably good
  health, you have doubtless been told to follow a plan very similar to the
  one we shall now briefly outline.</p>

  <p>For the first six months she can safely continue to do her household
  work. It is to her advantage to do so for many reasons, but especially
  because it helps to keep her physically in good condition, and because it
  keeps her mind engaged, thus avoiding a tendency to nervous worry. After
  the sixth month it is desirable to give up the heavier part of the work.
  Washing and sweeping should be absolutely prohibited. Moving furniture or
  heavy trunks must not be done by the prospective mother, but all light
  <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[76]</span>
  work can and should be indulged in to the very end. Find time to spend at
  least one hour and a half in the open air every day. Unless there is a
  medical reason against active exercise there is nothing so beneficial to
  the pregnant woman as walking, nor is there any substitute for it. A
  drive or motor ride into the country, or a car ride around town, is an
  excellent device against ennui and is highly desirable during this time,
  but not as a substitute for the daily long walk. A pregnant woman must
  keep her muscles strong and in good tone if she hopes to do her share
  toward having a short and easy confinement. She must keep active to
  ensure perfect action of all her organs&mdash;the stomach must digest;
  the bowels and kidneys must act perfectly; the heart, and lungs, and
  nerves must be supplied with good blood and fresh air; the appetite must
  be keen, and the sleep sound. Walking in the open air will do all this
  and nothing else can, to the same satisfactory degree.</p>

  <p>Light passive exercise at home is desirable to those very few who
  cannot walk in the open air, but at best it is a poor substitute. It is
  necessary to avoid any exercise or any labor of the following character
  from the very beginning of pregnancy: stretching, lifting, jarring,
  jumping, the use of the sewing machine, bicycling, riding, and
  dancing.</p>

  <p>She should continue to employ the same toilet privileges she has been
  accustomed to except the use of the vaginal douche, which must be stopped
  from the date of the first missed menstrual period. This is the only safe
  rule to follow and no exception should be made to it except upon the
  advice of a physician.</p>

  <p>Bathing during the entire course of pregnancy is a highly necessary
  duty. It is particularly advantageous during the later months because it
  relieves the kidneys at a time when they are called upon to perform an
  excess of work. The temperature of the bath should be warm and rapidly
  cooled at the finish. Brisk rubbing with a course towel will ensure the
  proper reaction.</p>

  <p>Sexual intercourse must be restricted during pregnancy; and it should
  be wholly abstained from during what would have been the regular
  menstrual periods, if <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>[77]</span> pregnancy had not occurred, for the reason
  that abortion is apt to take place. It is most harmful during the early
  and late months of pregnancy. Sexual intercourse is distasteful to most
  and harmful to every pregnant woman.</p>

  <p><b>Clothing During Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;The clothing should be so
  constructed as to relieve any undue pressure on the breasts or abdomen.
  For this reason it should be suspended from the shoulder. When it is
  appreciated that clothing supported by the waist crowds the growing womb,
  and exerts pressure upon the kidneys, and is responsible for many of the
  kidney complications that occur during pregnancy, no further reason need
  be given for discarding all clothing, except very light garments, that
  are not held by some device whose support is from the shoulders. A
  specially constructed linen waist is made and sold for this purpose. It
  is fashioned so that all the lower garments and the garters can be
  fastened to, and supported by it. Corsets should be absolutely discarded
  from the very first day of pregnancy.</p>

  <p>In a large woman with a lax abdomen, a properly made abdominal support
  will not only be a great comfort but of real advantage. It should exert a
  support upward by lifting the abdomen, not by constricting it. It should
  therefore be obtained from a reliable dealer and be made and applied to
  effect the above object,&mdash;otherwise it may do more harm than
  good.</p>

  <p><b>Diet of Pregnant Women.</b>&mdash;Some degree of digestive
  disturbance and loss of appetite is the rule early in pregnancy. By the
  fourth month these conditions invariably cease, and the appetite and the
  ability to digest will greatly improve. The diet from the very beginning
  of pregnancy should be plain and easily digested. It is not possible to
  formulate an absolute table of what or what not to eat, as the same foods
  do not agree equally well with all patients. The individual taste should
  be catered to within, reason, and the meals should be taken at regular
  intervals. Articles of diet that experience shows do not agree with the
  patient should be rigidly excluded from the menu. A varied diet of
  nutritious character is essential during pregnancy in order to ensure
  good blood, health, and strength. A monotonous diet, or a diet composed
  largely <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>[78]</span> of stale tea, coffee, and cake, is not
  permissible, and may do untold harm. Pastries and desserts of all kinds
  should be excluded. In the later weeks of pregnancy, because of the large
  size of the womb, the diet should be cut down as the stomach is
  interfered with in the process of digestion. Should the patient at any
  time during pregnancy experience a loss of appetite, or an actual disgust
  for food as sometimes occurs, it is preferable to suggest a change of
  scene and surroundings rather than the use of medicine. A short vacation,
  a change of table, new scenery, will promptly effect a cure. This
  condition is mental rather than physical; the patient allows herself to
  become introspective; the daily routine becomes monotonous and stale;
  hence a change of a few days will be all that is necessary. If it is not
  possible for the patient to obtain a change of scene, a complete change
  of diet for a few days will often tide over the difficulty. We have known
  patients to take kindly to an exclusive diet of kumyss, or matzoon, or
  predigested foods, with stale toast or zwieback, to which can be added
  stewed fruits. Alcoholic drinks should be left out entirely.</p>

  <p><b>The Mental State of the Pregnant Woman.</b>&mdash;The coming baby
  should be the text of many interesting, spontaneous talks between the
  young couple from the time when it is first known that a new member of
  the family is on its way. The husband should feel that he is a party to
  the successful consummation of the little one's journey. He can
  contribute enormously to this end. It should be his duty, born of a
  sincere affection and love, to formulate the programme of events which
  has for its main object the wife's entire mental environment. He should
  encourage her to live up to the physician's instructions, and arrange
  details so that she will obtain the proper exercise daily. He should read
  to her in the evening, and arrange his own business affairs so that he
  will be with her as much as is possible. In many little ways he can
  impress upon her the fact that they both owe something to the unborn babe
  and that each must sacrifice self in its behalf. His principal aim, of
  course, will be that she will not worry or have cause to worry. He will
  so direct her mental attitude that she will dwell <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>[79]</span> only upon the bright
  side of the picture; she will thus strive to realize the hope that the
  baby will be strong and healthy, and she will, prompted by his
  encouragement and devotion, try to do her duty faithfully. Working
  together in this way, much can be done that means far more than we know
  of, and in the end the little one comes into the world a welcome baby,
  created in love and born into the joy of a happy, harmonious, contented
  home.</p>

  <p><b>The Social Side of Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;The social side of the
  question should not be overlooked or neglected at this time. Here again
  the imperative necessity arises to warn the young wife against certain
  individuals who seem to have a predilection toward recounting all the
  terrible experiences they have heard regarding confinements. It is
  astonishing to learn how diversified a knowledge some women burden
  themselves with in this connection. They can recount case after case,
  with the harrowing details of a well-told tale, and seem to delight in so
  doing. Every physician has met these women. The young wife must not
  permit or encourage any reference to her condition. Simply refusing to
  discuss the question is the only sure method of preventing its
  discussion. She will find among her friends a few who have her best
  interests at heart, and these few will strive sincerely to be of real
  usefulness to her. If she will keep in mind that the most important
  element in the success of the whole period, and consequently the degree
  of her own health, happiness, and comfort, as well as that of her unborn
  baby, is the character of her own thoughts from day to day, and month to
  month, she will be complete master of the situation. By constantly
  dwelling on happy thoughts, reading encouraging and inspiring books,
  admiring and studying good pictures, working with cheerful colors in
  sunny rooms, exercising, dieting, and sleeping in a well-aired room, she
  will have no cause to regret her share in the task before her, or the
  kind of baby she will bring into the world.</p>

  <p><b>Minor Ailments of Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;There are certain minor
  ailments which it would be well to be familiar with lest a little worry
  should creep into the picture.</p>

  <p>Maternity is not only a natural physiological function, <!-- Page 80
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[80]</span> but it is a
  desirable experience for every woman to go through. The parts which
  participate in this duty have been for years preparing themselves for it.
  Each month a train of congestive symptoms have taxed their working
  strength; pregnancy is therefore a period of rest and
  recuperation,&mdash;a physiological episode in the life history of these
  parts. If any ailment arises during pregnancy it is a consequence of
  neglect, or injury, for which the woman herself is responsible,&mdash;it
  is not a natural accompaniment of, or a physiological sequence to
  pregnancy. Find out, therefore, wherein you are at fault, rectify it, and
  it will promptly disappear.</p>

  <p><b>Morning Nausea or Sickness.</b>&mdash;So-called morning nausea or
  sickness is very frequently an annoying symptom. It is present as a rule
  during the first two or three months of pregnancy. How is it produced and
  how can it be remedied?</p>

  <p>It is produced most frequently by errors in diet. It may be caused by
  an unnatural position of the womb or uterus, by nervousness,
  constipation, or by too much exercise or too little exercise. The
  physician should be consulted as soon as it is observed to be a regular
  occurrence. He will eliminate by examination any anatomical condition
  which might cause it; or will successfully correct any defect found. When
  the cause is defined his instructions will help you to avoid any error of
  diet, constipation, or exercise. Many cases will respond to a simple
  remedy,&mdash;a cup of coffee, without milk, taken in bed as soon as
  awake will often cure the nausea. The coffee must be taken while still
  lying down,&mdash;before you sit up in bed. If coffee is not agreeable
  any hot liquid, tea, beef tea, clam bouillon, or chicken broth, or hot
  water may answer the purpose, though black coffee, made fresh, seems to
  be the most successful. Ten drops of adrenalin three times daily is a
  very certain remedy in some cases, though this should be taken with your
  physician's permission only. If the nausea occurs during the day and is
  accompanied with a feeling of faintness, take twenty drops of aromatic
  spirits of ammonia in a half glass of plain water or Vichy water.
  Sometimes the nausea is caused by the gradual increase of the womb <!--
  Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>[81]</span> itself.
  This is not usually of a persistent character and disappears as soon as
  the womb rises in the abdominal cavity at the end of the second
  month.</p>

  <p>Nausea frequently does not occur until toward the end of pregnancy. In
  these cases the cause is quite different. Because of the size of the womb
  at this time the element of compression becomes an important
  consideration. The function of the kidneys, bowels, bladder, and
  respiration may be more or less interfered with, and it may be desirable
  to use a properly constructed abdominal support, or maternity corset.
  These devices support and distribute the weight, and prevent the womb
  from resting on or compressing, and hence interfering with, the function
  of any one organ. If the womb sags to one side, thereby retarding the
  return circulation of the blood in the veins from the leg, it may cause
  cramps in the leg, especially at night, or it may cause varicose veins,
  or a temporary dropsy. The correct support will prevent these troublesome
  annoyances; a properly constructed maternity corset is often quite
  effective. The diet should receive some special attention when these
  conditions exist. Any article of diet which favors fermentation
  (collection of gas) in the stomach or bowel should be excluded. These
  articles are the sugars, starches, and fats. It can readily be understood
  that if the bowels should be more or less filled with gas, or if they
  should be constipated, it will cause, not only great distress, but actual
  pain. Regulation of the diet, therefore, and exercise (walking best of
  all) will contribute greatly to the avoidance of these unnecessary
  sequelae.</p>

  <p>It must be kept in mind that the entire apparatus of the body is
  accommodating a changed condition, and though that condition is a natural
  one, it requires perfect health for its successful accomplishment. This
  means a perfect physical and mental condition,&mdash;a condition that is
  dependent upon good digestion, good muscles, healthy nerves, clean
  bowels, and so on. The slightest deviation from absolute health tends to
  change the character of the body excretions, the quality of the blood,
  etc. If the excretions are not properly eliminated, the blood becomes
  impure, and so we sometimes get itching of the body <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[82]</span> surfaces, especially of
  the abdomen and genitals; neuralgias, especially of the exposed nerves of
  the face and head; insomnia and nervousness. These are all amenable to
  cure, which again means, as a rule, correct diet and proper exercise as
  the principal remedial agencies.</p>

  <p><b>Undue Nervousness During Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;This is very largely
  a matter of will power. Some women simply will not exert any effort in
  their own behalf. They are perverse, obstinate, and unreasonable. The
  measures which ordinarily effect a cure, they refuse to employ. It is
  useless to argue with them; drugs should never be employed; censure and
  affection are apparently wasted on them; they cannot even be shamed into
  obedience. The maternal duty they owe to the unborn child does not seem
  to appeal to them. We do not know of any way to handle these women and to
  our mind they are wholly unfit to bring children into the world.
  Fortunately these women are few in number. The maternal instinct will,
  and does, guide most women into making sincere efforts to restrain any
  undue nervous tendency, and to be obedient and willing to follow
  instructions. There is nothing so beneficial in these cases as an
  absolutely regulated, congenial, daily routine, so diversified as to
  occupy their whole time and thought to the exclusion of any introspective
  possibility. Frequent short changes to the country or seashore to break
  the monotony, give good results in most of these cases. The domestic
  atmosphere must also be congenial and the husband should appreciate his
  responsibility in this respect.</p>

  <p>Women of this type should have their attention drawn to the following
  facts in this connection: While the most recent investigations of
  heredity prove that a woman cannot affect the potential possibilities of
  her child, she can seriously affect its physical vitality. The following
  illustration may render our meaning clear: suppose your child had the
  inborn qualities necessary to attain a 100 per cent. record of
  achievement in the struggle of life; anything you may or may not do
  cannot affect these qualities&mdash;the child will still have the ability
  to achieve 100 per cent. Inasmuch, however, as a mother can affect the
  health or physical qualities of her <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[83]</span> child she is directly
  responsible, through her conduct, as to whether her child will ever
  attain the 100 per cent. record, or if it does, she is responsible for
  the character of its comfort, its health, its enjoyment, all through its
  life's struggle toward the 100 per cent. achievement record. She may so
  compromise its physical efficiency that it will succumb to disease as a
  consequence of the ill health with which its mother unjustly endowed it,
  even though it possess the ability to attain the 100 per cent. if it
  lived.</p>

  <p>We often see brilliant children who are nervous and physically unfit,
  and we see others of more ordinary mental achievement who are healthy and
  robust animals. The one is the offspring of parents possessing unusual
  mental qualities but who are physically unable or unwilling to render
  justice to their progeny; the other parents may be less gifted mentally,
  but they are healthy and they are willing to give their best in conduct
  and in blood to their babies. Many of these brilliant children never
  achieve their potential greatness because they fall by the wayside owing
  to physical inability, while the healthy little animals achieve a greater
  degree of success because of the physical vitality which carries them
  through. To achieve a moderate success and enjoy good health is a better
  eugenic ideal than the promise of a possible genius never attained
  because of continuous physical inefficiency.</p>

  <p>The nervous and willful mother should therefore consider how much
  depends upon her conduct. It cannot be too frequently reiterated and
  emphasized that every mother should do her utmost to guard and retain her
  good health. Good health means blood of the best quality and this is
  essential to the nourishment of the child. To keep in good health does
  not mean to obey in one respect and fail in other essentials. It means
  that you must obey every rule laid down by your physician, willingly and
  freely in your own interest and in the interest of your unborn babe. In
  no other way may you hope to creditably carry out the eugenic ideal that
  "the fit only shall be born."</p>

  <p><b>Headache.</b>&mdash;This is a symptom of great importance. <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[84]</span> If it
  occurs frequently, without apparent cause, the physician should be
  consulted at once, as it may indicate a diseased condition of the
  kidneys, and necessitate immediate treatment. Headaches may, of course,
  be caused in many ways and most frequently they do not have any serious
  significance, but they must always be brought to the attention of the
  physician. As a rule they are caused by errors of diet,&mdash;too much
  sugar, candy, for instance, late and indigestible suppers, indiscriminate
  eating of rich edibles, etc.,&mdash;or they may be products of nervous
  excitement (too little rest), as shopping expeditions, strenuous social
  engagements, late hours, etc.</p>

  <p><b>Acidity of the Stomach, and So-Called Heartburn.</b>&mdash;These
  are sometimes in the early months of pregnancy annoying troubles. The
  following simple means will relieve temporarily: A half-teaspoonful of
  bicarbonate of soda or baking soda in a glass of water or Vichy water; or
  a half teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia in Vichy, or plain
  water; or a tablespoonful of pure glycerine. The best remedy is one
  tablespoonful of Philip's Milk of Magnesia taken every night for some
  time just before retiring.</p>

  <p>Heartburn is the result of eating improper food, or a failure to
  digest the food taken. Starchy foods should be avoided. Meats and fats
  should be taken sparingly. Avoid also the et ceteras of the table, as
  pickles, sauces, relishes, gravies, mustard, vinegar, etc. Good results
  follow dry meals,&mdash;meals taken without liquids of any kind. Live on
  a simple, easily digested, properly cooked diet. Chew the food
  thoroughly, take plenty of time and be cheerful.</p>

  <p><b>Constipation During Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;Most women are as a rule
  more or less constipated during pregnancy. It is caused by failure to
  take the proper amount of outdoor exercise, to take enough water daily,
  to live on the proper diet, to live hygienically, or because of wrong
  methods of dress. It is most important that the bowels should move
  thoroughly every day. Pregnancy no doubt aggravates constipation by
  diminishing intestinal activity. Consequently there is a greater need for
  activity on the part of the woman, and open air exercise is the best way
  <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>[85]</span> to
  accomplish this. She should eat fruits, fresh vegetables, brown or Graham
  bread, or bran muffins, figs, stewed prunes, and any article of diet
  which she knows from experience works upon her bowel. She should drink
  water freely; a glass of hot water sipped slowly on arising every morning
  or one-half hour before meals, is good. Mineral waters, Pluto, Apenta,
  Hunyadi, or one teaspoonful of sodium phosphate, or the same quantity of
  imported Carlsbad salts in a glass of hot water one-half hour before
  breakfast, answers admirably. If the salts cannot be taken a three- or
  five-grain, chocolate-coated, cascara sagrada tablet, may be taken before
  retiring, but other cathartics should not be taken unless the physician
  prescribes them. Rectal injections should be avoided as a cure of
  constipation during pregnancy. They are very apt to irritate the womb and
  if taken at a time when the child is active, they may annoy it enough to
  cause violent movement on its part, and these movements may cause a
  miscarriage. See article on "Constipation in Women."</p>

  <p><b>Varicose Veins, Cramps, and Neuralgia of the Limbs.</b>&mdash;When
  cramps or painful neuralgia occur repeatedly in one or both legs, some
  remedial measures should be tried. Inasmuch as the cause of this
  condition is a mechanical one, it would suggest a mechanical remedy. The
  baby habitually seeks for the most comfortable position, and having found
  it stays there until conditions render it uncomfortable. He does not
  consult you in the matter, but he may be subjecting you to untold misery
  and pain. The child may rest on the mother's nerves or blood-vessels as
  they enter her body from her lower limbs. If the pressure is sufficient,
  it can interfere quite seriously with the return blood supply, because
  veins which carry back to the heart the venous or used blood, are vessels
  with thin, soft, compressible walls, while arteries which carry blood
  away from the heart cannot be compressed easily, because their walls are
  hard and tense. The condition therefore is that more blood is being sent
  into the limb than is being allowed to return; in this way are produced
  varicose veins. If these varicose veins burst or rupture we have ulcers,
  which <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>[86]</span> may quickly heal, or they may refuse to
  heal, and become chronic. A dropsical condition of the leg may follow,
  and because of interference with the circulation of the blood we get
  cramps and neuralgias. How can we remedy this painful condition?</p>

  <p>Sometimes we don't succeed, but at least we can try. So long as the
  cause exists, it is self-evident that rubbing the limb with any external
  application, will not give any permanent relief, though it is well to
  try. When rubbing, to relieve cramps at night, always rub upward. It is
  not a condition that calls for medicine of any kind, while hot baths and
  hot applications will only make the trouble worse. The remedy that
  promises the quickest and longest relief is for the patient to assume the
  knee-chest position for fifteen minutes, three times a day, till relief
  is permanently established. The patient rests on her knees in bed, and
  bends forward until her chest rests on the bed also. The incline of the
  body in this position is reversed; hips are highest, the head lowest. The
  baby will seek a more comfortable position and this new position may
  relieve the pressure and cure the condition. Doing this three times daily
  for fifteen minutes gives relief to the leg by reestablishing a normal
  blood circulation, and very soon the baby finds a new position that does
  not interfere with its mother's blood supply, and the cramps, and
  neuralgia and dropsy, and maybe the varicose veins will soon show
  improvement. Wearing the proper kind of abdominal support may help, as
  explained on page <a href="#page77">77</a>. If the varicose veins are
  bad, it is desirable to wear silk rubber stockings or to bandage the
  limbs.</p>

  <p><b>Insomnia During Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;Insomnia or sleeplessness is
  sometimes a vexatious complication during pregnancy. It seldom if ever
  becomes of sufficient importance or seriousness to interfere with the
  pregnancy or the health of the patient. Nevertheless, a period of
  sleeplessness lasting for two or three weeks is not a pleasant experience
  to a pregnant woman. It is most often met with during the latter half of
  pregnancy.</p>

  <p>There can be no question that every case of insomnia has definite
  cause, and can be relieved if we can find the <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[87]</span> cause. The only way to
  find it is to systematically take up the consideration of each case, and
  this is best done by the physician. He must have patience and tact; you
  must answer each question truthfully and fully. Your diet, personal
  conduct, exercise, condition of bowels, mental environment, domestic
  atmosphere, everything, in fact, which has any relation to you or your
  nerves, must be inspected with a magnifying glass. Some little
  circumstance, easily overlooked, of seemingly no importance, may be the
  cause of the trouble. You may need more outdoor exercise, or you may need
  less outdoor exercise. You may need more diversion, more variety, or you
  may need less. You may need a sincere, honest, tactful, patient confidant
  and friend, or you may need to be saved from your friends. You may be
  exhausting your vitality and fraying your nerves by social
  exigencies,&mdash;those empty occupations which fill the lives of so many
  fussy, loquacious females,&mdash;echoless, wasted, babbling moments, of
  supreme important to the social bubbles who ceaselessly chase them but of
  no more interest to humanity than the wasted evening zephyrs that play
  tag with the sand eddies on the surface of the dead and silent desert.
  You may have wandered from the narrow limitations of the diet allowable
  in pregnancy, or you may be the victim of an objectionably sincere
  relation who pesters you with solicitous inquiries of a needless
  character. Whatever it is, rectify it. A good plan to follow on general
  principles is to take a brisk evening walk with your husband just before
  bedtime, and at least two hours after the evening meal. Follow this with
  a sitz bath as soon as you return from the walk.</p>

  <p>A sitz bath is a bath taken in the sitting position with the water
  reaching to the waist line. It should last about fifteen minutes and the
  water should be comfortably hot. It is sometimes found that this form of
  bath creates too much activity on the part of the child and defeats the
  purpose in view. This is apt to be the case in very thin women when the
  abdomen is not covered by a sufficient layer of fatty tissue. These women
  will find it advisable to take, in place of the sitz bath, a sponge bath
  in a warm room, using the water rather cool than hot but in <!-- Page 88
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>[88]</span> a warm room.
  Rub your skin briskly but waste no time in getting into bed. A glass of
  hot milk, before going to bed, or when wakeful during the night, may
  serve as a preventive. When these measures fail the physician should be
  called upon to advise and prescribe.</p>

  <p><b>Ptyalism, or an Excessive Flow of Saliva.</b>&mdash;This is a
  common condition in pregnancy, but cannot be prevented. It is of no
  importance other than that it is a temporary annoyance.</p>

  <p>Itching of the abdomen can usually be allayed by a warm alcohol rub,
  followed by gently kneading the surface of the abdomen with warm melted
  cocoa butter, just before retiring.</p>

  <p><b>A Vaginal Discharge.</b>&mdash;Soon after pregnancy has taken place
  the woman may notice a discharge. It may be very slight or it may be
  quite profuse. In some cases it does not exist at all during the entire
  period. As a rule the discharge is more frequent and more profuse toward
  the end of pregnancy.</p>

  <p>If the discharge exists at any time,&mdash;and it is no cause for
  worry or alarm if it does exist,&mdash;inform your physician. He will
  advise you what to do, because it is not wise for you to begin taking
  vaginal douches or injections without his knowledge, and at a time when
  they may do you serious harm. Should itching occur as a result of any
  vaginal discharge the following remedial measures may be employed:</p>

  <p>A solution of one teaspoonful of baking soda to a douche bag of tepid
  water may be allowed to flow over the parts, or cloths saturated with
  this mixture may be laid on the itching part. A solution of carbolic acid
  in hot water (one teaspoonful to one pint of hot water), is also useful,
  or a wash followed by smearing carbolic vaseline over the itching parts.
  If your physician should suggest a mild douche for itching of the vagina
  as the result of a discharge, it may be promptly relieved by using
  Borolyptol in the water. Buy a bottle and follow directions on the
  label.</p>

  <p><b>Testing Urine In Pregnancy&mdash;Importance of.</b>&mdash;One of
  the most important duties, if not the most important, of both the
  physician and the patient is to have the <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>[89]</span> urine of the pregnant
  woman examined every month during the first seven months and every two
  weeks during the last two months. The urine examined during the first
  seven months should be the first urine passed on the day it is sent for
  examination. During the last two months of pregnancy the <ins
  class="correction" title="'pateint' in original">patient</ins> should
  pass all her water into a chamber for an entire day, and take about three
  ounces of this mixed water for examination. She should measure the total
  quantity passed during these days and mark it with her name on the label
  of the bottle. The physician will thus have an absolute record and guide
  of just how the kidneys are acting, and as they are the most important
  organs to watch carefully during every pregnancy, the greatest care
  should be taken to see that failure to note the first symptom of trouble
  does not take place.</p>

  <p><b>Attention to Nipples and Breast.</b>&mdash;The physician should
  inspect the breasts and nipples of every pregnant woman when she first
  visits his office. Frequently the nipples are found to have been
  neglected, probably subjected to pressure by badly fitting corsets or too
  tight clothing. Instructions gently to pull depressed nipples out once
  daily, if begun early, will result in marked improvement by the end of
  pregnancy. During the latter part of pregnancy the breasts should be
  carefully and thoroughly bathed daily in addition to the daily bath. This
  special bath should be with a solution of boric acid (one teaspoonful to
  one pint of water). After the bath apply a thin coating of white vaseline
  to the nipples. It may be necessary to resort to the following mixture to
  harden the nipples and to make them stand out so that the child can get
  them in its mouth: Alcohol and water, equal parts into which put a pinch
  of powdered alum; this mixture should be put in a saucer and the nipples
  gently massaged with it twice daily. A depressed nipple may also be drawn
  out by means of a breast pump. If the nipples are not pulled out the
  child will be unable to nurse. It may then be necessary to put the child
  on the bottle and when the nipples are ready he may not take them after
  being used to the rubber nipple. The breasts may become caked and as a
  caked breast is a very painful <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>[90]</span> and serious ailment it is wise to attend to
  this matter in time.</p>

  <p><b>The Vagaries of Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;Certain foolish, old-fashioned
  ideas, have crept into the minds of impressionable people regarding
  pregnancy, which are aptly termed vagaries. It is believed by some that
  if the pregnant woman is the victim of fright, or is badly scared, or
  witnesses a terrifying or tragic sight, her child will be, in some way,
  affected by it. If the incident is not of sufficient gravity to cause an
  abortion or a miscarriage it will not, in any way mark, or affect the
  shape of the child in the womb.</p>

  <p>It is believed by some that a child can be marked by reason of some
  event occurring to the mother while carrying it. This is not so; a child
  cannot be marked by any experience or mental impression of the mother.
  Some believe that the actual character of a child can be changed by
  influences surrounding the mother while carrying it. The character of a
  child cannot be changed one particle after conception takes place, no
  matter how the mother spends her time in the interim.</p>

  <p>It should be carefully understood that the character of the baby is
  entirely different from the physical characteristics of the baby. Were
  this not so it would be futile on the part of the mother to discipline or
  sacrifice herself in the interest of her baby. The baby's character will
  reflect the qualities of the combined union of mother and father. The
  baby's physical characteristics will largely depend upon the treatment
  accorded it by the mother during its intro-uterine life. Hence we lay
  down rules of conduct, diet and exercise in order to produce a good,
  sturdy animal, while the character or mind of the animal is a part of the
  fundamental species already created. In other words, no matter how much
  care you bestow upon a rose bush, its flower will still be a
  rose,&mdash;it may be a better rose, a stronger, sturdier rose, a better
  smelling and a more beautiful rose, but it is still a rose.</p>

  <p><b>Contact With Infectious Diseases.</b>&mdash;The pregnant woman
  should be warned against the danger of coming in contact with any person
  suffering from any infectious or contagious diseases. To become the
  victim of one <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>[91]</span> of these diseases near the time of labor
  would be a dangerous complication not only to the mother, but to the
  child. A woman is more liable to catch one of these diseases during the
  last month of pregnancy than at any other time. The most dangerous
  diseases at this period are Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Erysipelas, and
  all diseased conditions where pus is present.</p>

  <p><b>Avoidance of Drugs.</b>&mdash;It is a safe rule during pregnancy to
  avoid absolutely the taking of all medicines unless prescribed by a
  physician.</p>

  <p><b>The Danger Signals of Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;The following conditions
  may be of very great importance and may be the danger signals of serious
  coming trouble. They must not therefore be neglected or lightly
  considered. When any of them make their appearance send for the physician
  who has charge of your case, at once, and follow his advice whatever it
  may be.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><b>When to Send for the Physician in Confinement Cases.</b>&mdash;The
  physician should be notified just as soon as it is known that labor has
  begun. The adoption of this course is necessary for a number of reasons.
  It is only just that he should have an opportunity to arrange his work so
  that he may be at liberty to give his whole time to your case when he is
  wanted. He may not be at home at the moment, but can be notified, and can
  arrange to be on hand when your case progresses far enough to need his
  personal attention. It will relieve your mind to be assured that he will
  be with you in plenty of time. <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>[94]</span></p>

  <p>Don't worry unnecessarily if he does not come immediately when you
  notify him, provided you notify him at the beginning of labor. There is
  plenty of time. You have a lot of work to do before he can be of any
  help. Many women entertain the idea that a physician can immediately
  perform some kind of miracle to relieve them of all pains at any stage in
  labor. This is a mistaken idea. No physician can hasten, or would if he
  could, a natural confinement. He waits until nature accomplishes her
  work, and he simply watches to see that nature is not being interfered
  with. If something goes wrong, as it does now and again; or if the pains
  become too weak, or if the proper progress is not being made, he may help
  nature or take the case out of her hands and complete the confinement. If
  it is thought best to do this, there will be plenty of time.</p>

  <p><b>The Preparation of the Patient and the Conduct of Actual
  Labor.</b>&mdash;It is assumed that the patient has adhered to the
  instructions of the physician given during the early days of her
  pregnancy. These instructions included directions as to exercise, diet,
  bathing, etc.</p>

  <p>Having calculated the probable date of the confinement, it is the
  better wisdom to curtail all out-of-door visiting, shopping, social
  engagements, etc.,&mdash;everything in fact out-of-doors except actual
  exercise, for two weeks previous to the confinement date. The usual walk
  in the open air should be continued up to the actual confinement day. The
  daily bath may be taken, and it is desirable that it should be taken, up
  to and on the confinement day.</p>

  <p><b>The Meaning of the Term "Labor."</b>&mdash;By labor is meant, the
  task or work involved in the progress by means of which a woman expels
  from her womb the matured ovum or child. After the child has been carried
  in the womb for a certain time (estimated to be 280 days) it is ripe, or
  fully matured, and is ready to be born. The womb itself becomes irritable
  because it has reached the limit of its growth and is becoming
  overstretched. Any slight jar, or physical effort on the part of the
  patient, or the taking of a cathartic, is apt to set up, or begin the
  contractions which nature has devised as the process of "labor" by which
  the womb empties itself. <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>[95]</span></p>

  <p><b>The Beginning of Labor.</b>&mdash;When the first so-called pains of
  actual labor begin they are not always recognized as such. The
  explanation of this seeming paradox is that the "pains" are not always
  painful. A woman will experience certain undefined sensations in her
  abdomen; to some, the feeling is as if gas were rumbling around in their
  bowels; to others, the feeling is as if they were having an attack of not
  very painful abdominal colic; while others complain of actual pain. The
  fact that these sensations continue, and that they grow a little worse;
  and that the day of the confinement is due, or actually here, impresses
  them that something unusual is taking place; then, and not till then,
  does the knowledge that labor is really approaching dawn upon them.</p>

  <p>In due time one of these new sensations, which constitute the first
  stage of labor, will be more emphatic; there will be a little actual pain
  so that she will feel like standing still, holding her breath and bearing
  down. That is the first real labor pain and marks the beginning of the
  second stage of labor, and may be the first absolute sign that will leave
  no doubt in her mind that labor has begun.</p>

  <p>The nurse will now inquire into the condition of the patient's bowels.
  If they have not already moved freely that day, she will give the patient
  a rectal injection of one pint of warm soap suds into which one
  teaspoonful of turpentine is put. After the bowels have been thoroughly
  cleansed, the patient will be made ready for the confinement. The
  clothing necessary consists of dressing gown, night gown, stockings and
  slippers. These are worn as long as the patient is out of bed, when all
  but the night gown will be discarded. The entire body of the patient,
  from the waist line to the knees, should be thoroughly cleansed, paying
  particular attention to the private parts; first with warm water and
  castile soap, and then rendered aseptic by washing with four quarts warm
  boiled water into which has been put one teaspoonful of Pearson's
  Creolin. A soft napkin is then wrung out of water that has been boiled
  and cooled to a suitable temperature, and laid over the genital region,
  and held <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[96]</span> in place by a dry clean napkin, and allowed
  to remain there until the physician takes personal charge of the
  case.</p>

  <p><b>Length of the First Stage of Labor.</b>&mdash;There is no definite
  or even approximate length of time for the first stage of
  labor,&mdash;that, you may recall, was the more or less painless stage,
  or as it has been termed, the "getting-ready" stage. Inasmuch as it is an
  unimportant and practically painless stage, most patients do not mind it.
  They continue to be up and around and work as usual.</p>

  <p>The first stage of labor is utilized by nature in opening the mouth of
  the womb.</p>

  <p>The second stage of labor is utilized by nature in expelling the child
  into the outer world.</p>

  <p><b>Length of the Second Stage of Labor.</b>&mdash;After the second
  stage has begun, the length of time necessary to end the labor, assuming
  everything is normal, depends upon the strength and frequency of the
  pains. The stronger and more frequent the pains, the quicker it will be
  over. First confinements necessarily take longer, because the parts take
  more time to open up, or dilate, to a degree sufficient to allow the
  child to be born. In subsequent confinements, these parts having once
  been dilated yield much easier, thus shortening the time and the pains of
  this, the most painful, stage of labor. The average duration of labor is
  eighteen hours in the case of the first child, and about twelve hours
  with women who have already borne children. The time, however, is subject
  to considerable variation, in individual cases, as has been pointed
  out.</p>

  <p><b>Conduct of the Patient During the Second Stage of
  Labor.</b>&mdash;She should remain up, out of bed, as long as she
  possibly can. The object of this is because experience shows that the
  labor pains are stronger, and more frequent, when in the upright
  position. Even though this procedure would seem to invite more constant
  suffering, it must be remember that labor is a physiological, natural
  process, that there is nothing to fear or dread; and if the patient is in
  good health, it is to her advantage to have it over soon, rather than to
  encourage a long drawn out, exhausting labor. When the pains come <!--
  Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span> she
  should be told to hold on to something, to hold her breath as long as
  possible, and to bear down. A good plan is to roll up a sheet lengthwise,
  and throw it over the top of an open door and let her grasp both ends
  tightly and bear down; or she can put her arms over the shoulders of the
  nurse and bear down. Instruct her to hold her breath as long as she can,
  bearing down all the time, and when she can't hold it any longer, tell
  her to let up, and then take a quick deep breath and bear down again,
  repeating this programme until the pain ceases. Tell her specifically to
  be sure to keep bearing down till the end of the pain, because the most
  important time, and the few seconds during which each pain does most of
  its work during the second stage of labor, is at the very end of each
  pain. When a woman understands that these instructions are for her good,
  and that they are given with the one purpose of saving her pain, and
  shortening the length of labor, she will try to obey. Each pain is
  intended by nature to do a certain amount of work, and each pain will
  accomplish that work if the woman does not prevent it; and if she does
  prevent it, she is only fooling herself, because the next pain will have
  to do what she would not allow the former to do, and so on according to
  how she acts.</p>

<h4>THE CARRIERS OF HERITAGE</h4>

    <p>Here is the actual bridge from this generation to the next.</p>

    <p>Into these two little bodies&mdash;the larger not over
    one-twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter&mdash;is condensed the
    multitude of characteristics transmitted from one generation to
    another.</p>

    <p>The vital part of the <i>Ovum</i> is the <i>Nucleus</i>, which
    contains the actual bodies that carry heritage&mdash;the little grains
    that are the mother's characteristics&mdash;<i>Chromosomes</i>. This
    nucleus is nourished by oils, salts and other inclusions, known as
    <i>Cytoplasm</i>. Floating in the cytoplasm may be found a tiny body
    known as the <i>Centrosome</i>, which acts as a magnet in certain
    phases of cell development. Around this whole mass is a <i>Cell
    Wall</i>, more or less resisting and protective.</p>

    <p>The <i>Spermatozoan</i> is structurally much different from the
    ovum, but it also has its nucleus and chromosomes, which carry to the
    child the transmittable characteristics of the father.</p>

    <p>The ovum is usually comparatively large and stationary, and whatever
    motion is therefore necessary to bring it into contact with the male
    cell devolves upon the latter, which possesses what is known as a
    <i>locomotor tail</i>. In addition there are usually many sperms to one
    ovum, so that the chances are that at least one male cell will reach
    the egg and effect fertilization, and the beginning of a new life.</p>

    <p>The diagrams on the opposite page show the actual steps by which the
    spermatozoan unites with the ovum. It is the very first stage of the
    process of cell multiplication that results in the offspring.</p>

  </div>
  <p><b>How a Willful Woman Can Prolong Labor.</b>&mdash;For a certain
  time, during the second stage of labor, a willful, unreasonable woman,
  can work against nature and save herself a little pain by prolonging the
  issue; but there will come a time when, the head having reached a certain
  position, the expulsive pains will be so great that she won't be able to
  control them and nature then seems to take her revenge. So if a woman
  holds back, and begins to cry, and scream, when she feels a pain coming,
  she renders the pain to a large degree negative, she prolongs her labor,
  adds to the total number of pains, exhausts herself, and endangers the
  life of her child. It must, however, be remembered in all justice that
  this is a time when it is much easier to preach than to practice.</p>

  <p>Every confinement is a new experience; no matter how many a physician
  may have seen, there are no two <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>[98]</span> alike. It is one of the interesting
  psychological problems in medicine to observe the conduct of women during
  their first confinement.</p>

  <p>Some are calm, exhibiting a degree of self-control that is admirable.
  They are willing to be instructed, and they recognize that the advice is
  given for their benefit. They conscientiously try to obey suggestions,
  and they make praiseworthy efforts to keep themselves under control. They
  are stoics.</p>

  <p>Others collapse at once; they go to pieces under the slightest excuse,
  and frequently without as much as an excuse. As soon as the pain begins,
  they willfully ignore all the instructions given and desperately and
  foolishly try to escape what they cannot escape. In this unreasonable
  selfishness they resent advice, and at the same time they implore you to
  "do something" for them. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of
  conduct; and any prospective mother who, because of a willful trait in
  her disposition, refuses to profit by the kindly professional advice of
  her physician or nurse, should at least have some consideration for her
  unborn babe. It may seem unkind to criticise the conduct of any woman at
  such a time. It is not prompted by a lack of patience or justice however.
  These women permit, in spite of every assurance to the contrary, an
  unreasonable fear to overwhelm them; and because of this fear they refuse
  to be guided into a path of conduct that will save them suffering and
  shorten the pains which they complain of. It is our conviction that if a
  woman would try to follow the advice of the physician at this time, at
  least half of all the seeming suffering would be avoided. We are glad to
  be able to truthfully state that this type of woman is vastly in the
  minority.</p>

  <p>When the second stage has advanced far enough, the patient will decide
  to go to bed. It may be necessary to put her in bed earlier, if her pains
  are very strong, as there is always a possibility of suddenly expelling
  the child under the influence of a strong pain. She will, as previously
  stated, discard all clothing, except her night gown, which can be folded
  up to her waist line and let down as far as necessary after the
  confinement is over. The obvious advantage of this arrangement is <!--
  Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[99]</span> that
  the gown remains unsoiled, and saves what would be needless trouble if it
  proved necessary to change the night gown at a time when the tired-out
  patient needs rest. Much aid may be afforded the woman at this stage by
  twisting an ordinary bed sheet and putting it around one of the posts or
  bars of the foot of the bed. The patient may then pull on the ends during
  the pain; she may also find much comfort and aid by bracing her feet on
  the foot of the bed while pulling. It is desirable to instruct the nurse
  to press on the small of the back during these pains. Some women
  appreciate a hot water bottle in this region. If the pains are hard the
  patient may perspire freely; it is always refreshing occasionally to wipe
  the face and brow off with a cloth wrung out of cold water. Cramps of the
  limbs may be relieved by forcibly stretching the leg and pulling the foot
  up toward the knee. From this time until the child and after-birth are
  born the physician will take active charge of the case.</p>

  <p><b>The Management of the Actual Birth of the Child.</b>&mdash;Near the
  end of the second stage of labor it will be observed that the pains have
  grown strong, expulsive, and more frequent. Very soon the advancing head
  will begin to push outward the space between the front and back passage;
  the rectum is pushed outward and the lips of the vagina open. If an
  anesthetic is to be used these are the pains that call for it. A few
  drops may be dropped singly on a small clean handkerchief held up by the
  middle over the nose, its ends falling over the face. A few drops will
  just take the edge off the pains, and render them quite bearable. As soon
  as the pain is over the patient should rest, relax completely, and not
  fret and exhaust herself worrying about the pains to come. It is
  astonishing how much actual rest a woman can get between pains if she
  will only try; and it is astonishing how much concentrated mischief a
  willful, unreasonable woman can do in the same time. She will not try to
  rest, but cries and moans and pleads for chloroform, until she succeeds
  in giving everyone except the physician and nurse the impression that she
  is suffering unnecessarily. Her husband or her mother, <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[100]</span> whichever is
  present, gets nervous; they begin to wonder if the physician is really
  trying to help; assume a long, sad, serious face! forget their promise to
  look cheerful, and mayhap offer sympathy to the woman. It is a trying
  moment and needs infinite patience and tact. The physician attends
  strictly to his duty, which will now be to guard the woman against
  exerting too great a force during the last few pains. About this time, or
  before it in many instances, the "waters will break." This means simply
  that the bag or membrane in the contents of which the child floated burst
  because of the pressure of a pain. This is a perfectly natural procedure
  and should not cause any worry: simply ignore it as if it had no bearing
  on the labor in any way. As soon as the oncoming head has dilated the
  passage sufficiently, so that the edges of the entrance to the vagina
  will slip over the head without tearing, the physician allows the head to
  be born. It takes some time to do this, and he must hold the head back
  until just the right moment. It is best not to let the head slip through
  at the height of a pain, or rupture is sure to occur. Wait till it will
  slip through as a pain is dying out, and if you have waited long enough
  and handled the head skillfully, the conditions will be just right at a
  certain moment to permit this without tearing the parts. There are some
  cases where a tear, and a good tear, is impossible to guard against. It
  is not a question of patience, or tact, or skill; it is a combination of
  conditions which patience, tact, and skill are powerless against.</p>

  <p><b>Position of Woman During Birth of Child.</b>&mdash;The position of
  the woman is a matter of choice and is not contributory to the results at
  all. She can lie on her back, which is the ordinary way, or on her side,
  as the physician or the patient prefer. As soon as the head is born the
  physician should see that the cord is not round the child's neck; if it
  is, release it. The shoulders will most likely be born with the next or
  succeeding pain. The physician will permit the lower shoulder to slip
  over the soft parts first; this is done by retarding the upper shoulder
  by pushing it gently behind the pubic bone of the mother. When the
  shoulders are through, the <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>[101]</span> rest of the body of the child slips out
  without effort.</p>

  <p><b>Duty of Nurse Immediately Following Birth of Child.</b>&mdash;As
  soon as the child is born the nurse should sit by the side of the mother
  and hold the womb until the after-birth is expelled. The womb can be
  easily felt in the lower part of the woman's abdomen as a hard mass. It
  feels about the size of an extra large orange. The object of holding it
  is to prevent the possibility of an internal hemorrhage. It can be
  readily appreciated that the interior of a womb, immediately after a
  child is born, is simply a large bleeding wound. So long as the womb
  remains firmly contracted there is very little chance for an extensive
  bleeding to take place. As a rule the womb remains sufficiently
  contracted to preclude a hemorrhage until the after-birth is out. After
  the after-birth is expelled, the womb usually closes down firmly and the
  liability to bleed is very much reduced. Because there is a distinct
  chance or tendency for the womb to bleed freely during the time the
  after-birth remains in, it is customary, as stated above, to watch it
  closely and to hold it securely. It is best held with the right hand. The
  fingers should surround the top of the womb and exert a slight downward
  pressure. Should it show any tendency to dilate or fill with blood, get
  it between the fingers and the thumb and squeeze it, pushing downward at
  the same time.</p>

  <p><b>Expulsion of After-Birth.</b>&mdash;The after-birth is usually
  expelled in about twenty minutes after the child is born. Great care
  should be experienced in its expulsion. It should not be pulled at any
  stage of its expulsion. If it does not come easily give it a longer
  time,&mdash;it takes time for the womb to detach itself from the
  after-birth; and some after-births are very firmly attached. Eventually
  it will come out with a little encouragement in the way of frictional
  massage of the womb through the abdominal walls. If the membranes remain
  in the womb after the body of the after-birth is out, do not pull on
  them. Take the after-birth up in the palm of your hand and turn or twist
  it around, and keep turning it around gently, thereby loosening the
  membranes from the womb instead of pulling them, which would surely break
  them, leaving <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[102]</span> the broken ends in the womb, and, as a
  result, the chance of developing serious trouble.</p>

  <p>The patient should now be given one teaspoonful of the fluid extract
  of ergot, which should be repeated in an hour. Should there be an
  excessive flow of blood after this period it may be again repeated at the
  third hour.</p>

  <p><b>Cutting the Cord.</b>&mdash;As soon as the child is born, and of
  course long before the after-birth is expelled, the physician will tie
  the cord. This is best done at two places, one about two inches from the
  child, and the other two or three inches nearer the mother. Cut the cord
  about one-half inch beyond the first ligature, which will be between the
  two ligatures. The cord should be tied with sterile tape made for the
  purpose, or heavy twisted ligature silk, or a narrow, ordinary, strong
  tape, previously boiled. It should be tied firmly and inspected a number
  of times within one hour of its birth. It is possible for a baby to lose
  enough blood from a cord badly tied to cause its death. A very good way
  to ensure against such an accident is to cut the cord one inch from the
  ligature nearest the baby, then turn this inch backward and retie with
  the same ligature, thus making a double tie at the same spot. Cut the
  cord with scissors that have been boiled and reserved for this
  purpose.</p>

  <p><b>Washing Baby's Eyes and Mouth Immediately After Birth.</b>&mdash;As
  soon after birth as is practicable, wash the baby's eyes with a saturated
  solution of boracic acid.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the eyes have been washed the physician will drop
  into them a solution of silver nitrate, three drops of a two per cent.
  solution in each eye, or argyrol, three drops 20 per cent. solution. This
  precaution is taken against possible infection during labor and, as
  explained elsewhere, it is a preventive against certain diseased
  conditions which, if present, would result in blindness.</p>

  <p>The physician should then wind a little sterile cotton round his
  moistened little finger, dip it in the boracic solution, and holding the
  baby up by the feet head down, insert this finger into the throat, thus
  clearing it of mucus. The tongue and mouth may be gently washed with the
  same solution. <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>[103]</span></p>

  <p>After the baby has cried lustily as an evidence of life and strength,
  he should be wrapped up in a warm blanket quickly, and immediately put in
  a cozy basket in a warm place, and left there undisturbed, with his eyes
  shaded from the light until the nurse is ready to attend to him. The baby
  should be laid on his right side.</p>

  <p><b>Conduct Immediately Following Labor.</b>&mdash;As soon as the
  physician is satisfied that the patient is well enough to be left in care
  of the nurse or attendant, every effort should be made to favor a long,
  refreshing sleep. Nothing will contribute to the patient's well-being so
  much as a quiet, restful sleep after labor. The nurse will therefore take
  the baby into another room, fix the mother comfortably, and give her a
  glass of warm milk,&mdash;draw the shades or lower the light and tell the
  tired-out mother to go to sleep. As a rule she will sleep easily, as she
  is sore and exhausted.</p>

  <p><b>After-Pains.</b>&mdash;In women who have had children the womb does
  not as a rule contract down as firmly as after the first confinement.
  This condition permits of slight relaxation of the muscular wall, at
  which times there is a slight oozing of blood. This blood collects and
  forms clots in the uterine cavity which acts as irritants, exciting
  contractions in the effort to expel them. These contractions cause what
  are commonly known as "after-pains." These pains last until the womb is
  free from blood-clots. They may be severe the first twenty-four hours and
  then gradually die out during the following two or three days. Ordinarily
  in uncomplicated confinements they rarely annoy the patient longer than a
  few hours. It is a rare exception to observe them after the first
  confinement.</p>

  <p><b>Rest and Quiet After Labor.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the birth chamber
  is the rendezvous for all the inquisitive ladies in the neighborhood. No
  one should be permitted in the lying-in chamber until the patient is
  sitting up, except the husband and the mother. This should be made an
  absolute rule in every confinement. This is a period that demands the
  maximum of uninterrupted rest and repose. The world and all its concerns
  should remain a blank to a woman during the whole period of her
  confinement. This is the only successful means of <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>[104]</span> obtaining mental rest.
  The husband and mother should be instructed to present themselves just
  often enough to demonstrate their interest in the welfare of the patient
  and the baby.</p>

  <p><b>Position of the Patient After Labor.</b>&mdash;After delivery a
  woman should be instructed to lie on her back, without a pillow, for the
  first night. On the following morning she may have a pillow, but she must
  remain on her back for the first week. Sometimes an exception may be made
  to this rule by letting the patient move around on the side, with a
  pillow supporting the back, on the fourth day. These exceptional cases
  are those whose womb has contracted firmly, as shown by the quick change
  in the amount and color of the lochia. Women should be told why they must
  remain on their backs as explained in the chapter: "How long should a
  woman remain in bed?"</p>

  <p><b>The Lochia.</b>&mdash;The discharge which occurs after every labor
  is called the lochia. Its color is red for the first four or five days;
  for the succeeding two or three days it is yellow; for the remainder of
  its existence it is of a whitish color. It lasts from ten days to three
  weeks.</p>

  <p>The odor of the lochia is at first that of fresh blood; later it has
  the odor peculiar to these parts. If at any time the odor should become
  foul or putrid it is a danger signal to which the nurse should
  immediately draw the physician's attention.</p>

  <p>If the amount of the lochia should be excessive it should be
  investigated.</p>

  <p><b>The Events of the Day Following Labor.</b>&mdash;We will assume
  that the patient enjoyed a long sleep and wakes up refreshed, and with a
  thankful feeling that all is over and that baby is safely here. She will
  want to see and caress baby, of course. Lay the baby down in bed beside
  her and let her love and mother it. Tell her not to lift it, for the
  strain might injure her, then quietly steal away for ten or fifteen
  minutes, for these are precious, sacred moments. Motherhood&mdash;that
  angel spirit, whose influence every human heart has felt&mdash;that
  guards and guides the world in its sheltering arms&mdash;is born in its
  divine sense, into the heart of every woman for the <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[105]</span> first time,
  as she gazes in ecstasy and wonder at her first-born. She feels that she
  has begotten a trust,&mdash;a trust direct from her Creator, and she
  makes a silent resolve, as she gently and timidly feels the softness of
  baby's cheek, that she will watch over it, and guide it, and do all a
  mother can for it, with God's help. It is good for the race that mothers
  do feel this way: and it is good for all concerned that they be given the
  opportunity to be so inspired.</p>

  <p>Just as gently take the baby away at the expiration of the allotted
  time. Take it with a cheerful, smiling word, and do not comment upon
  mother's happy, thoughtful face, she will quickly collect herself and
  enter into the spirit of quiet congratulation that should now permeate
  the home.</p>

  <p><b>The First Breakfast After Labor.</b>&mdash;If the patient has
  passed a comfortable night, feels well, and is free from temperature, and
  has a normal pulse, breakfast will consist of a cup of warm milk, or a
  cup of cocoa made with milk, a piece of toasted bread, and a light boiled
  egg; or if preferred a cereal with milk and toasted bread. This will be
  the breakfast for the two following days also. The milk, or the cocoa
  (whichever is taken), must be sipped, while the attendant supports the
  patient's head. The cereal, or the egg (whichever is taken), must be fed
  to the patient out of a spoon. The patient must not make any physical
  effort to help herself; she must remain relaxed. Even when she sips her
  milk, or cocoa, she must not make any effort to raise her head; the nurse
  must support its entire weight. This will be the absolute routine of
  every meal until the physician gives permission to change the procedure.
  It is a waste of time to formulate rules only to disobey them.</p>

  <p>Shortly after breakfast the patient's toilet should be attended to.
  She should have her hair combed, and her face and hands washed. The hair
  on the right half of her head should be combed while the head rests on
  the left side, and vice versa. The water used for washing the hands and
  face should be slightly warmed. It is best to keep the hair braided and
  to consult the wishes of the patient as to the frequency of combing it.
  <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>[106]</span></p>

  <p><b>The Importance of Emptying the Bladder After Labor.</b>&mdash;An
  effort should be made now to have the patient urinate. This is very
  important at this time, as it is not an uncommon experience to find that
  the abdominal muscles are so worn out and overstrained with the fatigue
  of labor that they refuse to act when an effort is made to urinate. As a
  consequence the bladder becomes distended and may have to be emptied by
  other means. This condition is a temporary and a painless one, and will
  rectify itself in a day or two; meantime, if this accident has occurred,
  it is essential that the bladder should be emptied from time to time
  until the patient can do it herself. To test this function place the
  patient on the bed pan into which a pint of hot water has been put, and
  give her a reasonable time to make the effort to pass her water. Should
  she fail, take an ordinary small bath towel and wring it out of very hot
  water, just as hot as she can tolerate, and spread it over the region of
  the bladder and genitals: if there is running water in the room, turn it
  on full and let it run while the towel is in position as above. If the
  bladder is full, there is a peculiar, irresistible desire to urinate when
  one hears running water. If this effort fails, report the fact to the
  physician when he makes his daily call; he will draw the urine and it
  will be part of his daily duty to give specific instructions regarding
  this function until nature reëstablishes it.</p>

  <p>No particular attention need be paid to the bowels for the first two
  days. On the morning of the third day, if they have not acted of their
  own accord, the physician will give the necessary instructions to move
  them. The means necessary to accomplish the first movement after a
  confinement is a matter of choice. The old-time idea was to use castor
  oil, and while other remedies are now more or less fashionable, castor
  oil is still an excellent agent. Enemas are frequently used, but their
  use is questionable in this instance, inasmuch as a movement has not
  taken place for three days, the object is to clean out the whole length
  of the intestinal tract, and an enema is limited to part of the large
  intestine only,&mdash;according to how it is given. If the small <!--
  Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span>
  intestines are not thoroughly emptied, particles of food may remain
  there, and if so, they will putrify and the patient runs the risk of
  developing gas,&mdash;sometimes to an enormous extent. This affliction is
  painful, and dangerous, and nearly always unnecessary. It is always,
  therefore, more safe, and more desirable, to use some agent by the mouth,
  and we know of no better one than castor oil; and as castor oil can be so
  masked as to be practically tasteless at any drug-store soda fountain
  there can be small objection to it. My custom is to send the nurse or
  husband with an empty glass to the drug store to have the mixture made
  there and brought back ready for use. We have frequently obtained it in
  this way and given it to the patient without her knowing what it was. The
  best time to give castor oil is two hours after a meal, and two hours
  before the next meal&mdash;i.e., on an empty stomach. It works quicker
  and does not nauseate when the stomach is empty.</p>

  <p><b>Instructing the Nurse in Details.</b>&mdash;The nurse will attend
  to the patient's discharges by changing the napkins frequently. The
  bruised parts should be washed twice daily, for the first three or four
  days. If the nurse is a trained graduate nurse a few directions will
  suffice. If she is not a trained nurse the physician should be explicit
  in his instructions. It would be better if he actually showed her just
  how he wanted this work done. The best way to cleanse the vulvæ or
  privates is to take an ordinary douche bag at the proper height (about
  three feet) and allow the solution (1 to 2,000 bichlorid) to run over the
  parts into the douche pan, but do not touch any part of the patient with
  the nozzle of the douche bag. While she is directing the water with the
  left hand she should have a piece of sterile cotton in the right hand
  with which she will gently mop the parts. This method ensures disengaging
  any clotted blood and is aseptic. Dry the parts afterwards with a soft
  sterile piece of gauze and apply a clean sterile napkin.</p>

  <p><b>Douching After Labor.</b>&mdash;A nurse should never give a vaginal
  douche without instructions from the physician. Douches are not necessary
  in the convalescence of ordinary uncomplicated confinement cases. When it
  is <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[108]</span> necessary to give vaginal douches after a
  confinement, there are good reasons why they should be given, and it is
  therefore absolutely essential that they should be given properly, and
  with the highest degree of aseptic precautions. If these rules are not
  observed, the danger of causing serious trouble is very great, and as the
  physician is directly responsible for the conduct of the case, he should
  in justice to himself and his patient, do the douching himself.</p>

  <p><b>How to Give a Douche.</b>&mdash;The proper way to give a vaginal
  douche after a confinement, when the parts are bruised and lacerated, and
  when, as a consequence, the possibility of infection is very great, is as
  follows:</p>

  <p>Instruct the nurse to boil and cool about two quarts of water and have
  another kettle of water boiling. Boil the douche bag and its rubber
  tubing and the glass douche tube (do not use the hard rubber nozzle that
  comes with the ordinary douche bag). Drain off the water after it has
  boiled for ten minutes, but instruct the nurse not to touch the bag or
  tube, to leave them in the pan, covered, till the physician uses them.
  When the physician calls, place the patient on a clean warm douche pan
  while he is sterilizing his hands and making the solution ready. While he
  is douching the patient the nurse will hold the bag. The bag should not
  be held higher than two feet above the level of the patient.</p>

  <p><b>Advantages of Putting Baby to the Breast Early After
  Birth.</b>&mdash;The patient can now take, and will likely be ready for,
  an hour's nap. After the rest it is desirable to put the baby to the
  nipple, first carefully cleaning the nipple with a soft piece of sterile
  gauze dipped in a saturated solution of boracic acid. The reasons for
  this are as follows:</p>

  <p>1st. There is in the breasts of every woman after confinement a
  secretion known as "colostrum" which has the property of acting as a
  laxative to the child, in addition to being a food.</p>

  <p>2nd. It is advisable that the child's bowels should move during the
  first twenty-four hours and the colostrum was put there partly for that
  purpose.</p>

  <p>3rd. The act of suckling has a well-known influence <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span> on the womb,
  in that it distinctly aids in contracting it, and thereby expelling
  blood-clots and small shreds of the after-birth which might cause trouble
  if left in.</p>

  <p>4th. By nursing the colostrum out of the breasts, it will favor and
  hasten the secretion of milk.</p>

  <p>5th. It is frequently easier for the baby to get the nipple before the
  breast is full of milk, and having once had the nipple it will be easier
  to induce him to take it again when it is more difficult to get.</p>

  <p><b>The First Lunch After Labor.</b>&mdash;Lunch will be next in order,
  and that should consist of a clear soup,&mdash;chicken broth, mutton
  broth, beef broth with a few Graham wafers or biscuits, and a cup of
  custard or rice pudding. This will be the lunch for the two following
  days also. The same precautions are to be observed in giving this as were
  observed with breakfast and as will be observed with all other meals as
  clearly stated before, and repeated again, so that no mistake may be
  made. In the middle of the afternoon the patient can take a cup of beef
  tea or a cup of warm milk.</p>

  <p><b>The First Dinner After Labor.</b>&mdash;Dinner will consist of more
  broth, or a plate of clear consomme with a dropped egg, or a cereal, a
  little boiled rice with milk, and stewed prunes, or a baked apple.</p>

  <p>After the bowels have moved, on the third day, and provided the
  temperature and pulse have been normal since the confinement, the patient
  can be put on an ordinary mixed diet, particulars regarding which are
  given on page <a href="#page121">121</a> under the heading "Diet for the
  nursing mother."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><b>Regarding the More or Less Prevalent Dread or Fear of
  Childbirth.</b>&mdash;Much has been written, and much more could be
  written upon this subject. Inasmuch as this book is largely intended for
  prospective mothers to read and profit thereby, and is not for physicians
  and nurses whose actual acquaintance with confinement work would render
  such comments superfluous, it will not be out of place to consider this
  phase of the subject briefly, from a medical standpoint. When one
  considers that "a child is born every minute" as the saying goes, and
  which is approximately true, and at the same time remembers that
  statistics prove, as near as can be estimated, that there is only one
  death of a mother in twenty thousand confinements, it would really seem
  as though we were "looking for trouble" to even regard the subject as
  worthy of the smallest consideration. It is much more dangerous to ride
  five miles on a railroad, or on a street car, or even take a two-mile
  walk,&mdash;the percentage possibility of accident is decidedly in your
  favor to stay at home and have a baby. Almost any disease you can mention
  has a higher, a much higher fatality percentage than the risks run by a
  pregnant <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span> woman. The real justification for actual
  fear of serious trouble is so small that it barely exists. These are
  facts that cannot be argued away by any specious if or and. Why,
  therefore, should there be any real fear?</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear of the remarks made by a famous philosopher who was
  given a dinner by his friends in celebration of his 85th birthday? In
  replying to the eulogisms of his friends he said in part:</p>

  <p>"As I look back into those blessed years that have faded away, I can
  recall a lot of troubles and many worries as well as much happiness and
  pleasure, and thinking of it all this evening I can truthfully say my
  worst troubles and worries never happened."</p>

  <p>So it is with the woman who for weeks or months has made her own life
  wretched, and possibly the life of her husband and friends, the same in
  imagining all kinds of dreadful things that never take place. It is
  undoubtedly an exhibition of weakness, an evidence of failure in the
  development of self-control. Childbirth is a natural process,&mdash;there
  is nothing mysterious about it. If you do your part you have no cause to
  fear,&mdash;the very fact, however, that you entertain a dread of it,
  shows that you are not doing your part. One of the saddest parts of life,
  one of the real tragedies of living, is the fact that most of us have to
  live so long before we really begin to profit by our experiences. Could
  we only be taught to learn the lesson of experience earlier, when life is
  younger and hope stronger, we would have so much more to live for and so
  many more satisfied moments to profit by. One of the most valuable
  lessons experience can teach any human being is not to worry and fret
  about the future. You can plant ahead of yourself a path of roses and be
  cheerful, or you can plant a bed of thorns and reap a thorny reward.
  Cultivate the spirit of contentment, devote all your energy to making the
  actual present comfortable. Don't fret about what is going to bother you
  next week, because, as the philosopher said, most of the troubles we
  anticipate and worry about never occur, but the worry kills.</p>

  <p><b>Regarding the Use of Anesthetics in
  Confinements.</b>&mdash;Anesthetics are as a rule given in all <!-- Page
  113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[113]</span>
  confinements that are not normal. To make this statement more plain it
  may be said, that, when it is necessary to use instruments, or to perform
  any operation of a painful character, it is the invariable rule to give
  anesthetics. As to the wisdom of giving an anesthetic when labor is
  progressing in a normal and satisfactory manner, there is a difference of
  opinion. Much depends upon the disposition of the patient and the
  viewpoint of the physician in charge of the case. It is a fact that a
  large number of confinements are easy and are admitted to be so, by the
  patients themselves, and in which it would be medically wrong to give an
  anesthetic. In a normal confinement, however, when the pains are
  particularly severe and the progress slow, there is no medical reason why
  an anesthetic could not be given to ease the pain. In these cases it is
  not necessary to render the patient completely unconscious. Sufficient
  anesthetic to dull each pain is all that is necessary, and as this can be
  accomplished with absolute safety by the use of an anesthetic mixture of
  alcohol, ether and chloroform, there can be no possible objection to it.
  The use of an anesthetic, however, is a matter that must be left entirely
  to the judgment of the physician as there are frequently good reasons why
  it should not be given under any circumstances.</p>

  <p><b>The Presence of Friends and Relatives in the Confinement
  Chamber.</b>&mdash;It is a safe rule to exclude every one from the
  confinement room during the later stages of labor. Sometimes it is
  desirable to make an exception to this rule in the interest of the
  patient, by permitting the mother or husband to remain. If this exception
  is made, however, they must be told to conduct themselves in a way that
  will tend to keep the patient in cheerful spirits. They must not
  sympathize, or go around with solemn, gloomy faces. Cheerfulness and an
  encouraging word will tide over a trying moment when the reverse might
  prove disastrous.</p>

  <p>Practically the same rule applies to the entire period of
  convalescence during which time the patient is confined to bed. This is a
  very important episode in a woman's life and the consequences may be
  serious if it is misused in any way. Friends and relatives do not
  appreciate the <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span> absolute necessity of guarding the
  patient from small talk and gossip, and an unwitting remark may cause
  grave mental distress, which may retard the patient's convalescence and
  disastrously affect the quality and quantity of her milk, thereby
  injuring the child.</p>

  <p><b>How Long Should a Woman Stay in Bed After a
  Confinement?</b>&mdash;To answer this question by stating a specific
  number of days would be wrong, because, few women understand the need for
  staying in bed after they feel well enough to get up. If any answer was
  given, it should be at least fourteen days, and it would be nearer the
  truth medically to double that time. Let us consider what is going on at
  this period. The natural size of the unimpregnated womb is three by one
  and three-quarter inches, and its weight is one to two ounces. The
  average size of the pregnant womb just previous to labor is twenty by
  fourteen inches, and its weight about sixteen ounces. We have, therefore,
  an increase of about 600% to be got rid of before it assumes again its
  normal condition. This decrease cannot be accomplished quickly by any
  known medical miracle. Nature takes time and she will not be hurried: she
  will do it in an orderly, perfect manner if she is allowed to. The womb
  will again find its proper location and will resume its work, in a
  painless, natural way, in due time, if all goes well. The uterus or womb
  is held in its place by two bands or ligaments, one on either side, and
  is supported in front and back by the structures next to it. These bands
  keep the womb in place in much the same way as a clothes pin sits on a
  clothes line, and it will retain its proper place provided everything is
  just right. After labor, it is large and top heavy. If you put a weight
  on the top of a clothes pin as it sits on a clothes line, what will take
  place? It will tilt one way or the other, and if the weight is heavy, it
  will turn completely over. So long as the woman lies in bed the womb will
  gradually shrink back to its proper size and place; if she sits up or
  gets out of bed too soon, the weight of the womb, being top heavy, will
  cause it to tilt and sag out of its true position. As soon as it does
  this the weight of the bowels and other structures above will push and
  crowd it further <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[115]</span> out of place. This crowding and tilting
  interferes with the circulation in the womb and its proper contraction is
  interfered with, and thus is laid the foundation for the multitude of
  womb troubles that exist.</p>

  <p>It is a mechanical as well as a medical problem. Being partly
  mechanical, it is subject to the rules that govern mechanical problems.
  The importance of this dual process will be appreciated by considering
  the following fact. Many medical conditions tend to cure or rectify
  themselves because nature is always working in our behalf if we give her
  a chance. Take for example an ordinary cold. You can have a very severe
  cold and you can neglect it, and in spite of your neglect you will get
  well. It is not wise to neglect colds, nevertheless, it is true that
  nature will cure, unaided, a great many diseased conditions, if she has
  half a chance. This, to a very large extent, is the secret of Christian
  Science, yet the principle is known to everyone. A mechanical condition,
  on the other hand, has absolutely no tendency to get well of its own
  accord, or without mechanical aid. This is why Christian Science cannot
  cure a broken leg. It is this principle that makes diseases of the womb
  so persistent, and so stubborn of cure. When a womb once becomes slightly
  displaced, the tendency always is for it to grow worse and never to cure
  itself. The longer it lasts the worse it gets. Its cure depends upon
  mechanically putting it back in place and holding it long enough there to
  permit nature to reëstablish its circulation, and by toning and
  strengthening it so that when the mechanical support is taken away it
  will retain its position. There is no other possible way of doing it. Now
  since it has been proved that nature takes many days to contract a
  pregnant womb, a woman is taking a risk, and inviting trouble by getting
  out of bed before that time.</p>

  <p><b>Why Do Physicians Permit Women to Get Up Before the Womb is Back in
  its Proper Place?</b>&mdash;Without offering the excuse that a woman will
  not stay in bed as long as a physician knows she should, there is,
  however, a large degree of truth in this excuse. And we are of the
  opinion that, if a physician made it a rule to keep all his confinement
  cases in bed for one month, <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[116]</span> he would very soon find himself without
  these patients.</p>

  <p>Experience has taught us, however, that it is safe, under proper
  restrictions, and in uncomplicated confinements, to allow patients to sit
  up in bed on the 12th and in certain cases on the 10th day, and to get
  out of bed on the 12th or 14th day. When the patient is allowed to sit
  up, out of bed, it should not be for longer than one or two hours, and
  during that time she should sit in a comfortable rocking or Morris chair,
  which should be placed by the side of the bed. Each day the time can be
  lengthened, and the distance of the chair from the bed increased. This
  procedure gives her the opportunity to walk a little further each day,
  thereby to test her strength and ability to use her limbs. On the fourth
  day, if all has gone well, she may stay up all day and she may walk more
  freely about the room. She should be just to herself, however. As soon as
  she is fatigued she should not make any effort to try to "work it off."
  When a feeling of fatigue appears she should rest completely. If she has
  any pain or distress she should acquaint the physician with it at once.
  She should not try to hide anything on the mistaken idea that "it isn't
  much." She does not know, and she is not supposed to know what the pain
  may mean; it may be exceedingly significant. Many women have saved
  themselves needless suffering, and their husbands unnecessary expenditure
  of money, by calling the physician's attention to conditions, which in
  time would have been serious, and would have necessitated long, expensive
  treatment.</p>

  <p><b>Lacerations During Confinement, Their Meaning and Their
  Significance.</b>&mdash;The only interest a laceration or a tear has to a
  physician, is whether the laceration or tear is of sufficient importance
  to need surgical interference. The laceration can take place at the mouth
  of the womb, or on the outside, between the vagina and rectum.</p>

  <p>Those of the mouth of the womb always take place, in every
  confinement, to some degree. They are never given any attention at the
  time of the confinement, unless under extraordinary circumstances, such
  as a more or less complete rupture of the womb, and this is such a <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span> rare
  accident that most physicians practice a lifetime and never see or hear
  of one single case. Those on the outside are always attended to
  immediately after labor, or should be, unless they are very extensive and
  the patient is not in condition to permit of any immediate operative
  work. In such a case it is best to leave it alone until the patient is in
  condition to have it operated on at a later date.</p>

  <p>It is distinctly preferable to have it attended to immediately after
  labor when it is possible, and it is possible in a very large percentage
  of the cases. The explanation of this is because it is practically
  painless then, owing to the parts having been so stretched and bruised
  that they have little or no feeling. If it is left for a day or two and
  then repaired, it will be more painful, because the parts will have
  regained their sensitiveness. Another good reason in favor of immediate
  repair is that a much better and quicker union will take place than if
  postponed.</p>

  <p>When a patient is torn, but not to the degree necessary to stitch, it
  is to her advantage to be told to lie on her back and keep her knees
  together for twelve hours, thus keeping the torn edges together and at
  rest, thereby favoring quick and healthy repair of the tear. Some
  physicians go as far as to bind the patient's knees together so she
  cannot separate them during sleep.</p>

  <p>It is the custom of every conscientious physician to request every
  woman he confines to report at his office six or eight weeks after labor.
  The reason for this is to find out by examination the character and
  extent of the lacerations of the mouth of the womb. No physician can tell
  at the time of labor just how much damage has been done, because the
  mouth of the womb, at the time of labor, is so stretched and thinned out,
  that it is impossible to tell. After the womb has contracted to about its
  normal size, it is a very simple matter for any physician to tell exactly
  the character and extent of the lacerations. Most of these tears need
  absolutely no attention; there are a few however that do. This is a very
  important matter for two very good reasons.</p>

  <p>1st. Every woman should know, and is entitled to <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[118]</span> know, just
  what condition she is in, because if she has been torn to an extent that
  needs attention, and is left in ignorance of it, her physical health may
  be slowly and seriously undermined and the cause of it may not be
  understood or even guessed at. A woman who becomes nervous and irritable,
  loses vim and vitality, has headaches, backaches and anemia, and no
  symptoms, or few, that point to disease of the womb, will suffer a long
  time before she seeks relief of the right kind, and will be astonished
  and outraged when she is told that it all results from a bad tear of her
  womb that she knew nothing about.</p>

  <p>2nd. A physician should in justice to himself insist on this late
  examination, because if a woman is told, at some subsequent time, by
  another physician that she is badly torn, and she was not told of it by
  the physician who confined her, she is very apt to form an unjust opinion
  of his work and to entertain an unfriendly feeling toward him as a
  man.</p>

  <p>Some physicians also, to their discredit, are not slow in permitting
  an unjust opinion of a colleague to be spread around, by preserving a
  silence, when an explanation would result in an entirely different
  opinion by the patient. They permit it to be inferred that the physician
  was responsible for the tear, when such is not the case. No physician on
  earth can prevent a tear of the mouth of the womb and this should be
  explained to the patient. Where the physician is at fault is in the
  failure to examine his patients when it is possible to tell that a tear
  of any consequence exists. If such an examination is made, he is in a
  position to state that a tear exists of sufficient extent to justify
  careful attention. Immediate operation is seldom necessary, and if the
  patient is comparatively young, it may not be wise to operate, because if
  pregnancy takes place within a reasonable time the womb will again tear.
  She should be told, however, that should she not become pregnant during
  the next three years she should be examined from time to time, and if the
  condition of her womb, or her health suggest it, she should have the tear
  attended to. If after this explanation she neglects herself she must
  blame <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>[119]</span> herself, she will at least have no cause
  to harbor any resentment against her physician who has done all any
  physician is called upon to do under the circumstances. Another important
  reason for finding out the character of the laceration is because these
  lacerations of the mouth of the womb frequently cause sterility.</p>

  Maid.</b></p>

</blockquote>

  <p><b>The Diet of Nursing Mothers.</b>&mdash;A nursing mother should eat
  exactly the same diet as she has always been accustomed to before she
  became pregnant. If any article of diet disagrees with her she should
  give up that particular article. She should not experiment; simply adhere
  to what she knows agreed with her in the past. More, rather than less,
  should be taken, especially more liquids as they favor milk-making. It is
  sometimes advisable to drink an extra glass of milk in the mid-afternoon
  and before retiring. If milk disagrees, or is not liked, she may take
  clear soup or beef tea in place of it. In a general way milk in
  quantities not over one quart daily, eggs, meat, fish, poultry, cereals,
  green vegetables, and stewed fruit constitute a varied and ample dietary
  to select from.</p>

  <p>Every nursing mother should have one daily movement of the bowels; she
  should get three or four hours' exercise in the open air every day; and
  she should nurse her child regularly.</p>

  <p>The diet of the nursing mother during the period immediately after
  confinement is given elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Alcohol, of all kinds, should be absolutely avoided during the entire
  period of nursing.</p>

  <p>Drugs of every variety, or for any purpose, should never be taken
  unless by special permission of her physician.</p>

  <p><b>Care of the Nipples.</b>&mdash;As soon as the mother has had a good
  sleep after the confinement the nipples should be <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span> washed with a
  saturated solution of boracic acid, and the child allowed to nurse. The
  milk does not come into the breast for two or three days, but the child
  should nurse every four hours during that time. There is secreted at this
  time a substance called colostrum. This is a laxative agent which nature
  intends the child should have as it tends to move the bowels and at the
  same time it appeases the hunger of the infant. It also accustoms the
  child to nursing and gradually prepares the nipples for the work ahead of
  them.</p>

  <p>After each nursing the nipples should be carefully washed with the
  same solution and thoroughly dried.</p>

  <p><b>Cracked Nipples.</b>&mdash;Cracked nipples often result from lack
  of care and cleanliness. If they are not cared for as described above
  they are very apt during the first few days to crack. They should never
  be left moist. They should be washed and dried after every feeding. If
  the breasts are full enough to leak they should be covered with a pad of
  sterile absorbent gauze.</p>

  <p>Nursing mothers should guard against cracked nipples, as they are
  exceedingly painful; frequently necessitating a discontinuance of
  nursing; and may produce abscess of the breast.</p>

  <p><b>Treatment of Cracked Nipples.</b>&mdash;In addition to washing the
  nipples, drying them thoroughly, and placing a pad of dry gauze over them
  after each feeding, they should be painted with an 8 per cent. solution
  of nitrate of silver twice daily. Before the next feeding, after the
  silver has been used, they should be washed with cooled boiled water. If
  the cracks are very bad it may be necessary to use a nipple-shield over
  them while nursing for a few days.</p>

  <p><b>Tender Nipples.</b>&mdash;Many women complain of the pain caused by
  the baby when it is first put to the breast. These nipples are not
  cracked, they are simple hypersensitive. They should be thoroughly
  cleansed and dried as above and painted with the compound tincture of
  benzoin. They should be washed off with the boracic acid solution before
  each feeding. After a few days under this treatment the tenderness will
  leave them.</p>

  <p><b>Mastitis in Nursing Mothers.</b>&mdash;When inflammation of <!--
  Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>[123]</span> the
  breast takes place in a nursing mother it is the result of exposure to
  cold, or it may result from injury. If infection occurs and an abscess
  develops, it results from the entrance, through the nipples, or cracks,
  or fissures in the nipple, of bacteria into the breast. There is fever,
  with chills and prostration, and very soon it is impossible to nurse the
  child because of the pain. Nursing should be immediately discontinued,
  the breast supported by a bandage and the milk drawn, with a breast pump,
  at the regular nursing intervals. An ice-bag should be constantly applied
  to the painful area and the bowels kept freely open with a saline
  laxative. When the fever and the pain subside nursing may be resumed.</p>

  <p>If the gland suppurates in spite of treatment it must be freely opened
  and freely drained.</p>

<h4>WEANING</h4>

  <p><b>When to Wean the Baby.</b>&mdash;Medically there is no exact time
  at which the baby should be weaned. Certain conditions indicate when it
  should be undertaken. It is desirable to wean the baby between the tenth
  and twelfth months. A month or two one way or another will not make much
  difference if the mother and child are in good condition. It should be
  weaned between the periods of dentition rather than when it is actively
  teething. The time of year is important. It would be better to wean it
  before the hot weather if it is strong and has been accustomed to taking
  other food than the breast milk. On the other hand it would be decidedly
  better to defer the weaning until the fall, rather than risk weaning at
  the tenth or twelfth months if these fall during the height of the hot
  weather.</p>

  <p><b>Methods of Weaning.</b>&mdash;The best way to wean is to do it
  gradually. It is not desirable to take the mother's milk away suddenly
  unless there is a very good reason for it. The child should be fed small
  portions of suitable other food at the beginning of the tenth month. By
  the end of the tenth month he should be taking a feeding two or three
  times a day of food other than the breast milk. This feeding may be given
  in a bottle. In some cases <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>[124]</span> the mother may be able to feed the child
  with a spoon instead of the bottle. The substitute feedings allowable at
  this age are given in another chapter.</p>

  <p><b>Times When Rapid Weaning is Necessary.</b>&mdash;There are times
  when the child must be weaned suddenly, as, for example, at the death of
  the mother, serious sickness of the mother, or in cases where for any
  cause the mother suddenly loses her milk. In these cases it is best to
  wean at once. If an infant refuses to take the bottle under such
  circumstances, the best plan to adopt, and the wisest one in the long
  run, is to starve the child into submission. If he gets absolutely
  nothing but the bottle he will shortly take it without protest. If a
  meddling individual attempts to feed the child some other food and tries
  to coax it to take the bottle in the meantime, much harm may result; it
  is safe only to fight it out for a day or two and win than to half starve
  the child and lose in the end.</p>

  <p>The child should be weaned if it is not gaining in weight. This may
  indicate a deficient quality of the mother's milk, or it may indicate a
  lack of proportion between the child and mother. If a robust child is
  depending upon the nourishment furnished by a mother who is not in good
  physical condition the milk may not be adequate in quality and quantity.
  The child will not therefore develop normally and it may be necessary to
  wean it.</p>

  <p>If the mother becomes pregnant it will be necessary to wean, because
  pregnancy invariably affects the quality of the milk. It is a very good
  habit to accustom the child to take its daily supply of water from a
  bottle from a very early age. This procedure will make it easier to wean
  at any time.</p>

  <p>Menstruation is not an indication for weaning as has been explained.
  If, however, the return of menstruation affects the milk so that it
  disagrees with, or fails to satisfactorily nourish the child, it may be
  necessary to wean, but not unless.</p>

  <p>The best reason for weaning a child at the twelfth month is that a
  mother's milk after that time is not adequate in quality for a child of
  that age. A child at one year of age has grown beyond the capability of
  its <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>[125]</span> mother to nurse it: nature demands a
  stronger and a more substantial food than any mother can supply. A mother
  who nurses her child beyond that period is not only injuring herself, but
  she is cheating her child. The exception to this rule is, as has been
  explained, the second summer.</p>

  <p>The child will evidence its dissatisfaction with the breast supply if
  it is not enough; it will not gain in weight, it will be irritable and
  fretful, it will tug long and tenaciously at the nipple, it will be
  unwilling to cease nursing after it should have finished, and it will
  drop the nipple frequently with a dissatisfied cry. These are all signs
  of insufficient nourishment, and to the observant mother they will at
  once indicate that the child must be weaned and fed upon a mixed
  diet.</p>

  <p><b>Care of Breasts While Weaning Child.</b>&mdash;The process of
  weaning should cause little or no discomfort. If the weaning is gradual
  it is necessary to press out enough milk to relieve the tension from time
  to time. It usually takes three or four days.</p>

  <p>If it is necessary to wean abruptly, as it is occasionally, there may
  be considerable distress. In these cases it is necessary to massage the
  breasts completely,&mdash;until all the milk is out, or as much as it is
  possible to get out,&mdash;then rub the breasts with warm camphorated
  oil, and bind them firmly. When the breasts are massaged for any reason,
  the rubbing should be toward the nipple and it should be done gently. If
  there are any hard lumps, or caked milk, in the breasts, they must be
  massaged until soft, and the binding renewed. It may be necessary to
  repeat this process for a number of days. In binding the breasts use a
  large wad of absorbent cotton at the sides, under the arms, to support
  the breasts, and another wad between the breasts. This renders the
  binding more effective; permits the binder to be put on tighter; and
  prevents it from cutting into the skin. When weaning has to be done
  quickly the patient should absolutely abstain from all liquids. A large
  dose of any saline, Pluto, Apenta, or Hunyadi Water, or Rochelle salts,
  or Magnesium Citrate, should be given every morning for four or five
  days. <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>[126]</span></p>

  <p>If the weaning is gradually undertaken the child should be allowed to
  nurse less frequently. One less nursing every second day until two
  nursings daily are given. Keep the two daily nursings up for one week and
  then discontinue them, after which the above measures may be adopted. To
  dry the milk up, the breasts may be anointed with the following mixture:
  Ext. Belladonna, 2 drams; Glycerine, 2 ounces; Oil of Wintergreen, 10
  drops.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous Nursing Mothers.</b>&mdash;Nervousness, considered not as
  the product of a diseased condition, but as a temperamental quality, is
  an unfortunate affliction in some nursing mothers. Let us illustrate just
  how this characteristic is detrimental to the helpless baby. A mother was
  instructed to give her baby a half teaspoonful of medicine one-half hour
  after each feeding. She was told how to give it, and how to hold the baby
  when giving it. She was also told that the baby would not like it, and
  would try to eject it from its mouth rather than swallow it, and that
  when it did swallow it, it would make a little choking noise in its
  throat, but not to mind these, to go ahead and give it, as the baby could
  not strangle or choke. It was essential to give the baby this medicine,
  and hence the physician explicitly instructed her in these details. What
  was the result? On the following day when the physician called, and found
  the baby much worse, the mother said: "Oh, doctor! I couldn't give the
  medicine, the baby wouldn't take it, she nearly strangled to death when I
  tried to give it." The physician asked for the medicine and placing the
  baby over his knee, gave it without the slightest trouble, much to the
  mother's amazement. The servant girl who was a hard-headed, cool, Scotch
  girl, was instructed and shown how to give the medicine, which she did
  successfully. The mother was temperamentally nervous, was easily excited
  and became helpless the moment the baby objected, though she was a
  strong, robust, healthy woman.</p>

  <p>Another mother was carefully instructed to drop into the eye of her
  baby two drops of medicine every four hours. She was told and apparently
  appreciated the <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>[127]</span> urgent necessity of the medication as her
  baby's eye was badly infected. She was further told that if she did
  exactly as shown, the eye would be better in two or three days, and if
  she did not, the other eye would become infected, and blindness might
  result. She undertook to carry out the directions faithfully. She
  absolutely failed, however, to carry out the instructions. Her husband
  informed the physician on the following day that she became so nervous
  and excited that she utterly failed to treat the eye once, and when he
  and a sister offered their assistance she became so unreasonable in her
  fear that "they might hurt the baby" that it was impossible to do
  anything with her. Her sister was finally shown how to do it and carried
  the case through quite successfully.</p>

  <p>Inasmuch as this book is intended to convey helpful instruction to
  every mother, the author would suggest to those of this type the
  necessity of resisting this tendency. It is a matter of will power, just
  make up your mind not to be silly and if you find that you cannot trust
  yourself to follow instructions, let someone else do it. When the
  physician tells you a certain thing must be done, and that no harm can
  result, do it, and don't imagine all kinds of impossible happenings.</p>

  <p>So much anguish and <ins class="correction" title="'anoyance' in original"
  >annoyance</ins> is caused in this world by imagining and anticipating
  trouble, that half the pleasure of life is denied us. You cannot do your
  whole duty by a helpless baby if you do not reason and act upon sound
  judgment. Many babies are lost by mothers being afraid to do what should
  be done, and what they know should be done. It is not what the doctor
  does that brings a baby through a dangerous sickness; it is the
  faithfulness of the nurse in carrying out his instructions that is
  responsible for the outcome. A timid, halting, doubting nurse can quickly
  undo all a physician hopes to accomplish; while a prompt, faithful nurse,
  with initiative, and good judgment, can save a little life in a crisis,
  even in the absence of the physician. Follow instructions implicitly,
  even though the carrying out of the instructions seem to cause the baby
  pain and suffering,&mdash;it is for the baby's best interest.</p>

<p><!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[128]</span></p>

  <p><b>Birth Marks.</b>&mdash;Much has been written on this subject which
  a later study of biology and eugenics have shown to be utterly false. Let
  us consider the actual facts. The baby is already a baby, floating in a
  fluid of its own manufacture. It has absolutely no connection with its
  mother except by means of its umbilical cord,&mdash;which is composed of
  blood vessels. The blood in these vessels is the child's blood and never
  at any time does it even mix with the blood of the mother. It is sent
  along these vessels into the placenta, or after-birth, in which it
  circulates in small thin vessels, so close to the mother's blood that
  their contents can be interchanged. Yet the two streams never actually
  mix. The carbonic acid and waste products, in the child's blood, are
  taken up by the mother's blood, and given in exchange oxygen and food,
  which is returned to nourish the child. There is absolutely no nervous
  connection between the mother and the child. How then is it possible for
  the mother to affect her child in any way except insofar as the quality
  of its nourishment is concerned? Nor can a mother affect her child in any
  other sense. If the intermingling of blood could affect a child's
  education we would frequently resort to surgery. In the article on
  Eugenics, under the heading, "Education and Eugenics," it is explained
  that the child is "created" at the moment of conception; that absolutely
  nothing can affect it after it is created; that no influence of the
  mother or father can in any way affect it for better or worse. A mother
  cannot create in her child any quality which she may desire no matter how
  she conducts herself. It was formerly thought that a mother could for
  example create a musical genius by devoting all her time to the study of
  music while she carried the unborn child; or that she could make a
  historian of it if she studied history; or an artist if she studied
  paintings. We now know this to be wholly wrong and for very excellent
  reasons.</p>

  <p>The mother must realize that the only aid she can bestow upon her
  unborn child is to give it the best possible nourishment. She must
  provide good blood because the quality of the maternal blood stream
  bespeaks a healthy or unhealthy, a fit or unfit, child. Whatever the <!--
  Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>[129]</span>
  child is to be is already fixed, its innate characteristics art part of
  itself. Whether it will have the vitality to develop its inherent
  possibilities depends, to a great degree, upon its intra-uterine
  environment,&mdash;and its intra-uterine environment depends upon the
  health of its mother and the quality of the blood she is feeding it upon.
  After birth its health, its success, its efficiency, depends upon the
  care it gets and the quality of its mother's milk. A mother therefore
  must be in good physical and mental health if she hopes to do her full
  duty as a mother.</p>

  <p><b>Qualifications of a Nursery Maid.</b>&mdash;When a helper, or maid,
  is employed to aid in caring for the baby, much precaution should be
  exercised in selecting her. The association of the nursery maid and the
  child, is necessarity an intimate one, and she should be willing to
  submit to a medical examination to prove her physical fitness. Her lungs
  should be examined thoroughly, so also should the condition of her mouth,
  throat and nose be known. An observant and tactful mother will also find
  out if there are any other objectionable conditions existing, which would
  render her unfit for the position. A nursery maid should be naturally
  fond of children, she should be industrious, and sensible; of quiet
  tastes and good disposition. Her work should be a pleasure not a
  task.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h3>CONVALESCING AFTER CONFINEMENT</h3>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p><b>The Second Critical Period in the Young Wife's Life&mdash;The
  Domestic Problem Following the First Confinement.</b></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The first three or four months following the first confinement is the
  second important period in the young wife's life. In one sense it is the
  most critical period. The first important period you will remember we
  stated to be the first few months after marriage. During these months the
  young wife passed through the period of adaptation. She found out that
  matrimony was not all sunshine and happiness. She learned that her
  husband was not the paragon she had idealized. She discovered his human
  side. She met daily trials and annoyances incident to domestic life. She
  found her level, and, in finding it, she discovered herself. She is not
  very safely anchored yet but she is trying to succeed and the future
  promises well. Some day she awakes to the knowledge that she is pregnant
  and a multitude of new speculations enter into the situation. She finds
  she must go on striving and hoping and praying that she may have the
  strength and courage to do her part. Time passes, and if she is an
  ordinary woman she scarcely does justice to herself. Her duties are
  exacting, and her physical condition is not given the study and care
  which she ought to give it. She does not understand the importance of the
  hygiene of pregnancy, and the day of the confinement finds her more or
  less exhausted, and worn out. She passes through the crisis of maternity,
  however, and spends the customary ten days in bed. At the end of that
  period the nurse and physician leave her to face the most important
  problem of life alone. She is a mother, and has in her exclusive charge a
  human life.</p>

  <p>Let us exactly understand what the real situation is. It would not
  further the object of this book or help in the solution of the problem
  the author has in mind to depict <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span> a false situation. We
  must concede the following facts to be true, if we understand the
  subject:</p>

  <p>1. That the mothers of the human race are, in the vast majority, the
  poor.</p>

  <p>2. That they are uneducated in the sense that they are not versed in
  the science of hygiene and sanitation, and consequently health
  preservation.</p>

  <p>3. That even the fairly well educated are innocently ignorant of the
  science of heredity, environment, hygiene, sanitation and health
  preservation.</p>

  <p>4. That to benefit the majority we must depict conditions as they
  exist among the poor, and reason from that standard.</p>

  <p>Such books as have been written on this subject have based their facts
  upon too high a plane. Their remedies are beyond the means and the
  understanding of the average poor mother. Their analogies are based upon
  conditions that exist among the better class. The average poor housewife
  gets no practical assistance or help from their deductions, because her
  environment precludes any utilization of the data furnished; the data is
  not practical in her particular case.</p>

  <p>Our young mother is in all probability a physically and mentally
  immature girl. She most likely entered the marriage relationship without
  a real understanding of its true meaning, or even a serious thought
  regarding its duties or its responsibilities. She was not taught the true
  meaning of motherhood before actual maternity was thrust upon her. She
  has probably innocently acquired habits which are detrimental to her
  health and her morals; and she has no conception of the fundamental
  duties of a homemaker. Yet into the keeping of this woman a human life
  has been given.</p>

  <p>Her home surroundings are not such as to inspire confidence or from
  which to elicit encouragement. It has been a struggle to make ends meet;
  to keep the peace; to be hopeful and cheerful. If she has succeeded in
  keeping her home neat and clean and comfortable, it has been at the
  expense of her not too robust constitution. If she has made efforts to
  observe the amenities of life, to be true as wife, companion and
  confidant, it <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>[133]</span> has taxed her nerves, her courage and her
  vitality. She has frequently been at the breaking point but she has kept
  up because she felt it was her duty, and because there was nothing else
  to do.</p>

  <p>As she rests from her weary labor during the first long days after
  getting out of bed, the loneliness of it all crushes her. She is weak,
  nervous, and discouraged, and her white, wan face, with its tired,
  appealing eyes, bespeaks her anemic and hopeless condition. She is only a
  child herself, yet fate has crowned her with the holy diadem of
  motherhood. There are thousands of such mothers and yet posterity need
  not despair. This is just the beginning, and from such beginnings have
  sprung the heroes of the race. If the reader has carefully read the
  chapter on Heredity she will understand that the temporary condition of
  this mother is not important so far as the destiny of the child is
  concerned. The really important question is, How will this mother
  develop? The environment of the child depends upon the conditions with
  which its mother surrounds it. If she is a failure, the child's
  environmental influences will be unfavorable; if she proves worthy of her
  trust, if she progresses and masters her difficulties; if she is a good
  mother and a good homemaker the child's surroundings and influences will
  be favorable to the full development of its hereditary endowment. But it
  must be remembered that even an unfavorable environment need not prevent
  the hereditary promise from dominating the life of the individual.</p>

  <p>To return to our girl mother, upon whose slender shoulders the weight
  of a great responsibility rests,&mdash;we wish to concede that her burden
  is great. Her home duties are rendered more onerous because of her
  physical weakness and disability. The strain of nursing her fretful child
  is taxing her vitality and her nerves to the limit. Her disposition is
  imposed upon by the exactions of an uncomprehending husband. She is
  inclined to fretfulness and melancholia by the seeming uncharitableness
  of fate and fortune. Her moments of introspection are almost bitter. It
  is a critical period,&mdash;she has reached the breaking point. <!-- Page
  134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span></p>

  <p>Such moments are apt to be epochal. The turning of the wheel of
  fortune will decide the destiny of a human soul.</p>

  <p>It may be a friend who will supply the needed inspiration that will
  revitalize hope, and courage, and the determination to succeed. Or it may
  be a prayer, breathed in the silence of despair that will inspire the
  courage to fight on, and change the complexion of life.</p>

  <p>Once again we would advise such a young wife to calmly think matters
  over; to find out "what she is working for"; to assemble her ideals and
  to "know what she wants." There is nothing organically wrong. It is a
  condition, not a disease. She is discouraged, despondent, nervous and
  weak. The discouragement, despondency, and nervousness is a result of
  reduced physical vitality and lack of system. She is not efficient
  because she is not a trained worker. She is easily discouraged because
  anemia or bloodlessness fails to supply the oxygen necessary to a fight.
  There is no period in a woman's life when she is more apt to fall into a
  rut than at this time. Every element, spiritual and physical, which is
  necessary to stagnation and indifference is present, and it will take a
  bold and brave effort to resist the temptation to failure which has
  encompassed her.</p>

  <p>How can we suggest a remedy? She must first regain her health. She has
  simply a condition to combat, not a disease, and a definite system, a
  well laid out plan strictly adhered to will effect the result. She must
  regain her health, because, without health, she cannot hope to be
  efficient in work or agreeable in disposition, and she owes both to
  herself, to her husband and to her child. She must get out of doors. She
  must walk in the open air. There is absolutely nothing in life that will
  effect so miraculous a transformation in a discouraged, tired, weary and
  sick woman, as systematic daily walks in the open air. She must walk
  briskly, however, and she must desire to get well. We cannot get well if
  we do not wish to get well. One who walks with a purpose will walk erect,
  firmly and briskly; she will hold her chest up, and will breathe deeply,
  and she will drink in hope, and health, and happiness. It takes time to
  regain strength after <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135"></a>[135]</span> the strain of pregnancy and labor. Many
  women complain that they feel weak and do not regain strength quickly,
  but they make no effort. They must make a beginning. Sitting around
  waiting for it to come will not bring it. If they cannot walk a mile,
  they must walk half that distance to begin with; the five mile walk will
  follow in time. Many young mothers get into the habit of taking baby out
  in his carriage for an airing, and regard this as exercise for
  themselves. They join the baby brigade and parade up and down the block,
  or select a sunny spot where there are others on a like quest, and sit
  around exchanging confidences. These outings usually degenerate into
  gossiping parties and are a dangerous and questionable practice. They are
  no doubt good for the baby, but they are morally and physically bad for
  the young mother. This daily habit is called exercise, but it is in no
  sense physical exercise. The young mother should select a certain time
  each day, immediately after a nursing when baby is likely to sleep, and
  devote this period to walking. One hour each day will accomplish much in
  regaining and establishing health and strength, and appetite for the
  mother. No indoor work can take the place of a walk out of doors. It is a
  duty on the part of the nursing mother to do this. It will enable her to
  supply better milk; it will banish her tendency to nervousness; it will
  ensure a good appetite, good spirits, and sound sleep. It will make her a
  better mother and a better wife. Many young wives sow the first seeds of
  discontent, and ultimate failure during the natural depression that
  follows maternity.</p>

  <p>She must adopt system in the performance of her household duties. A
  good plan is to set aside a certain definite time for meals, when to
  begin cooking and when to end washing the dishes. Then arrange regarding
  the general household duties. Make a schedule for a week devoting each
  day to a certain task so that at the end of the week all the essential
  work will have been completed. By systematizing work in this way a great
  deal of ground can be covered and as time passes it will become easier,
  as many helpful ways will suggest themselves whereby time will be
  economized. <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>[136]</span></p>

  <p>Adopt a system with the baby. Many mothers are worn-out, nervous
  wrecks for no other reason than a lack of system in the management of the
  daily life of their offspring. If system is not adopted in feeding and
  caring for an infant it becomes irritable. To a sick, tired, weary mother
  an irritable child is an unspeakable torture. Begin right. Give it
  adequate, but no unnecessary attention. Nurse it every two hours, and at
  no other time. Wake it to nurse at its regular time. It will in a few
  days acquire the habit of feeding regularly and will sleep between
  feedings. Do not overfeed it. Remember babies never die from starvation,
  but many do by overkindness, and overfeeding is the most prolific cause
  of infant mortality known. Read the article on "How long should a baby
  nurse?" Keep the baby clean, comfortable and happy and you will not have
  a fretful child, but one that will be a constant inspiration and
  incentive to you.</p>

  <p>Find time to rest, take a mid-day nap. Get off occasionally to the
  country or the sea shore for a day or two. Keep up your interest in your
  personal appearance, be neat and clean, and invite the attention of your
  husband during the evening hour. Don't let him grow away from you. Be
  cheerful, encourage him to tell of his hopes and plans, and show an
  interest in his health and in his work. Do not forget the dominating
  influence on your efficiency, and on your happiness which the study habit
  possesses. Interest yourself in some art, cultivate your mind, and soon,
  sooner than you think, you will have forgotten your troubles and you will
  have regained your health.</p>

  <p>There is no other way to do it. There is no royal way in which it can
  be done which is not open to the poorest mother.</p>

  <p>An ocean voyage, a trip to Europe, a society Doctor, a professional
  masseur, beauty experts and miracle workers cannot accomplish more than
  you can in your poor apartment, if you "go about it in the right way and
  in the right spirit." Keep in mind always, that: "failure exists only in
  acknowledging it." Every task that is worth while is won by
  self-sacrifice, by self-abnegation, by patient, persistent, enthusiastic
  effort, and in no other way. The joy of consummation is reward enough for
  all human sacrifice.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
